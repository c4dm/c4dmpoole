**Time-varying and nonlinear audio processing using deep neural networks**

The present invention relates to audio processing, in particular audio processing using deep neural networks. This invention is on a general-purpose deep learning architecture for audio processing in the context of audio effects modeling. In this way, given an arbitrary audio processor, a neural network may learn and apply the intrinsic characteristics of this transformation. The architecture is capable of recreating the sound, behaviour and main perceptual features of various types of audio effects.

Application Number: PCT/GB2020/051150

**Method and Apparatus for Music Collection Navigation**

This application describes the means to effectively navigate and interact with a userâ€™s digital music collection or a computer generated music playlist by using 3D audio technology. This is achieved when several songs played simultaneously as if they were originating from different spatial locations. The user can then easily navigate around the 3D virtual sound space, listen briefly and select the song of choice by pointing and/or tilting a handheld device (eg. Wii, iPhone).

Application Number: GB0815362.9

**Anti-feedback Device**

This application desribes a technique to maximise the allowable gain of a changing linear system. The method automatically calculates the appropriate gain that should be applied to a system with changing frequency response. The method is particularly useful for mixing engineers, who have to continually revise their gain structure in order to maximize gain before feedback. The system differs from other feedback cancellation methods in that it introduces no audible artifacts which would distort the sound.

Application Number: GB0808646.4

**Music Editing**

This application covers means for incorporating semantic audio analysis (such as tempo, key, melody) within the work-flow of the recording process. It is envisioned that such systems will add musical intelligence to the standard pattern of working in the creation of music (i.e. in home and professional studios), and simplify the use of complicated tools.

Application Number: GB0708494.0

**Harmonic Sinusoids UK**

This application deals with means to analyse harmonic signals such as those from musical instruments. It allows for some in-harmonicity, such as is typical in real-world instruments. The application also describes how this analysis can be turned to deeper musicological use, such as understanding better how a particular singer creates a vibrato, and for creative uses, such as modifying the timbral composition of one or more notes, changing their pitch, and so on.
