Three C4DM PhD students and six C4DM academics will join the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>, the UK's national institute in artificial intelligence and data science, in Autumn 2021.

The following C4DM PhD students will join the Turing as Enrichment students in 2021/22:

* <a href="https://cheriell.github.io/">Lele Liu</a> - Enrichment project: Cross-domain automatic music audio-to-score transcription

* <a href="https://ilariamanco.com/">Ilaria Manco</a> - Enrichment project: Multimodal deep learning for music information retrieval

* <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7QiLTQAAAAJ&hl=en">Luca Marinelli</a> - Enrichment project: Gender-coded sound: A multimodal data-driven analysis of gender encoding strategies in sound and music for advertising

The Turing's <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment">Enrichment scheme</a> offers students enrolled on a doctoral programme at a UK university an opportunity to boost their research project with a placement at the Turing for up to 12 months.

The following C4DM academics have been appointed Turing Fellows in 2021/22:

* <a href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~emmanouilb/">Dr Emmanouil Benetos</a>

* <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~nickbk/">Prof. Nick Bryan-Kinns</a>

* <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/">Prof. Simon Dixon</a>

* <a href="https://pquochuy.github.io/">Dr Huy Phan</a>

* <a href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/saitischaralampos.html">Dr Charalampos Saitis</a>

* <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/sandlermark.html">Prof. Mark Sandler</a>

<a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-fellow-call-2021">Turing Fellows</a> are scholars with proven research excellence in data science, artificial intelligence or a related field whose research would be significantly enhanced through active involvement with the Turing network of universities and partners.
