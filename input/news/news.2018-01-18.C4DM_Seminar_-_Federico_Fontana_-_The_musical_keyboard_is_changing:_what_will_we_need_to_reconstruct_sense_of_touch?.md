Title
The musical keyboard is changing: what will we need to reconstruct sense of touch?

Abstract
After decades of research and industrial development centered around the electronic substitution of traditional (electro-)mechanic keyboards, current market trends point toward a progressive virtualization of the keyboard concept, essentially obtained by interfacing the performer to a compact mobile synthesizer through novel motion sensors and multi-modal actuators. The talk will deal with touch response, actually a key factor in piano and other keyboard instrument playing, whose credible virtualization must involve diverse aspects of the reproduction ranging from its accurate real-time synthesis to the auditory and tactile perception of sonic feedback. Detailing these aspects will be an occasion to present past and present research activities conducted by the speaker, in the fields of interactive sound processing and in the design and subjective evaluation of musical interfaces.
