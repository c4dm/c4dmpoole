On 19-24 July 2020, several C4DM researchers will participate virtually at the <b>[IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2020)](https://wcci2020.org/)</b>, taking place as part of the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI). 

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference:

* C4DM researchers Dan Stowell and Veronica Morfi are co-organising the [IJCNN special session on Deep Learning for Wildlife Bioacoustics, Ecology and Crop Science](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/news/news.2019-12-17.Bioacoustics_special_session_at_IJCNN.html).

The following papers authored/co-authored by C4DM members will be presented at the conference:

* <b>Automatic Lyrics Transcription using Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks with Self-Attention</b>
<br>Emir Demirel, Sven Ahlback and Dixon Simon

* <b>Conditioning Autoencoder Latent Spaces for Real-Time Timbre Interpolation and Synthesis</b>
<br>Joseph Colonel and Sam Keene
<br>[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11296)

* <b>Reliable Local Explanations for Machine Listening</b>
<br>Saumitra Mishra, Emmanouil Benetos, Bob L.T. Sturm and Simon Dixon
<br>[Paper](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/reliable-local-explanations-machine-listening)

* <b>Deep Feature Embedding and Hierarchical Classification for Audio Scene Classification</b>
<br>Lam Pham, Ian McLoughlin, Huy Phan, Ramaswamy Palaniappan and Afred Mertins
