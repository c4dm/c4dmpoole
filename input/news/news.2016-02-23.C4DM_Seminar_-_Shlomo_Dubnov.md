<span style="font-size: 130%;">Title</span></br>
Information theoretic creativity, or how to find the optimal automata for music?

<span style="font-size: 130%;">Abstract</span></br>
In recent years there was a significant advance in using statistical and machine learning tools for creating musical models that are capable of generating music in a particular style. In the talk I will survey some of the recent works on controlling or "guiding" such models according to user specifications. Specifically I will describe the work done in UCSD / CREL on Variable Markov Oracle modeling that allows optimal model selection for audio signals, with applications to motif detection and guided improvisation, as well as other time series applications*. The general framework of our work is rooted in information theoretical approaches that use notions of complexity and accuracy to combine analytical and generative models in a common framework.
