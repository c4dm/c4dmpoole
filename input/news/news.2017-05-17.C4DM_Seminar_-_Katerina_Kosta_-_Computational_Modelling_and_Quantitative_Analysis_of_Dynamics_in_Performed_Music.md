Computational Modelling and Quantitative Analysis of Dynamics in Performed Music

<span style="font-size: 130%;">Abstract</span></br>
Musical dynamics-loudness and changes in loudness-forms one of the key aspects
of expressive  music performance. Surprisingly this rather important research
area has received little attention.  A reason is the fact that while the concept
of dynamics is related to signal amplitude, which is a  low-level feature, the
process of deriving perceived loudness from the signal is far from
straightforward.

The PhD thesis presented advances the state of the art in the analysis of
perceived  loudness by modelling dynamic variations in expressive music
performance and by studying the relation between dynamics in piano recordings
and markings in the score.  In particular, we show that dynamic changes: a)
depend on the evolution of the  performance and the local context of the piece;
b) correspond to important score  markings and music structures; and, c) can
reflect wide divergences in performers' expressive strategies within and across
pieces.

All studies in this thesis are based on loudness levels extracted from 2000
recordings of 44 Mazurkas by F. Chopin. The research can be broadly categorised
into two parts. The first  investigates how dynamic markings map to performed
loudness levels. Empirical results show that different dynamic markings do not
correspond to fixed loudness thresholds.  Rather, the important factors are the
relative loudness of neighbouring markings, the  inter-relations of nearby
markings and other score information, the structural location of the markings,
and the creative license exercised by the performer in inserting further
interpretive dynamic shaping. The second part seeks to determine how changes in
loudness  levels map to score features using statistical change-point
techniques. The results show that significant dynamic score markings do indeed
correspond to change points. Furthermore,  evidence suggests that change points
in score positions without dynamic markings highlight  structurally salient
events or events based on temporal changes.

In a separate bidirectional study, we investigate the relationship between
dynamic markings  in the score and performed loudness using machine learning
techniques. The techniques  are applied to the prediction of loudness levels
corresponding to dynamic markings, and to the classification of dynamic markings
given loudness values. The results show that loudness  values and markings can
be predicted relatively well when trained across recordings of the same  piece,
but fail dismally when trained across a pianist's recordings of other pieces.
The findings  demonstrate that score features may trump individual style when
modelling loudness choices.  The analysis of the results reveal that form-such
as the return of the theme- and structure-such as repetitions-influence
predictability of loudness and markings.

This research is a first step towards automatic audio-to-score transcription of
dynamic markings.  This insight will serve as a tool for expression synthesis
and musicological studies.
