On 7-13 & 22-27 May, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2022)](https://2022.ieeeicassp.org/)</b>. ICASSP is the leading conference in the field of signal processing and the flagship event of the [IEEE Signal Processing Society](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/).

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The below papers presented at ICASSP 2022 are authored or co-authored by C4DM members:
