title: AES Workshop on Intelligent Music Production

-------------------

Author: Dave Moffat

The 8th September 2015 sees the Audio Engineering Society UK Midlands Section presenting a workshop on Intelligent Music Production at Birmingham City University.

As ever, C4DM have a strong presence at this workshop, as two of the six presented talks are by current C4DM members. Ryan Stables, the event organiser, and others at the Digital Media Technology (DMT) Lab in Birmingham City University are currently collaborating with C4DM on the Semantic Audio Feature Extraction (SAFE) project.

Josh Reiss will present a summary of the current state of the art in Intelligent Music Production, highlighting current research directions and the implications of this technology. Brecht De Man will present some of his PhD results in perceptual evaluation of music production as he attempts to understand how mix engineers carry out their work. Further to this, Alex Wilson was a previous C4DM visiting student for six months, and will be presenting his recently publishing work from Sound and Music Computing Conference, in navigating the mix space.
