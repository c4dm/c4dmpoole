<b>Title</b>: Physics-based Sound Synthesis, Virtual Acoustics and Audio Effects 

<b>Abstract</b>:
In this talk, Iâ€™ll give an overview of physics-based sound synthesis, virtual acoustics and audio effects, including the standard techniques, typical systems of interest, and then get into some more technical details about the operation of such methods, including numerical audio artefacts, parallelisation, real time operation, and finally reduced parameter sets describing such systems. Many sound and video examples will be shown.
