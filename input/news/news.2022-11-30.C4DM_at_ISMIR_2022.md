On 4-8 December 2022, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[23rd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2022)](https://ismir2022.ismir.net/)</b>. ISMIR is the leading conference in the field of music informatics, and is currently the [top-cited publication for Music & Musicology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=hum_musicmusicology) (source: Google Scholar). This year ISMIR will take place in Bengaluru, India, and online.

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact.
