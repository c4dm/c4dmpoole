Abstract: 
The use of music as an aid for improving body and mind has received enormous 
attention over the last 20 years from a wide range of disciplines, including neuroscience, 
cognitive science, physical therapy, exercise science, psychological medicine, and pedagogy. 
It is important to translate insights gained from the scientific study of music, learning, 
and medicine into real-life applications. Such applications should be delivered widely, effectively, 
and accurately, harnessing the synergy of sound and music computing (SMC), wearable computing, and 
cloud computing technologies to promote learning and to facilitate disease prevention, diagnosis, 
and treatment in both developed countries and resource-poor developing countries. In this talk, 
I will highlight our recent projects at NUS Sound and Music Computing Lab that are developed to 
facilitate joyful learning, and motivate physical Rehabilitation.

Biography : 
Wang Ye is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the National University of Singapore (NUS) 
and NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS). He established and directed 
the sound and music computing (SMC) Lab (www.smcnus.org). Before joining NUS he was a member of the 
technical staff at Nokia Research Center in Tampere, Finland for 9 years. His research interests include 
sound analysis and music information retrieval (MIR), mobile computing, and cloud computing, and their 
applications in music edutainment, e-Learning, and e-Health, as well as determining their effectiveness 
via subjective and objective evaluations. He has served as the general chair of ISMIR2017 
(https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/) and TPC co-chair of ICOT2017 (http://www.colips.org/conferences/icot2017/). 
His most recent projects involve the design and evaluation of systems to support 1) therapeutic gait training 
using Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), 2) auditory training and second language learning.
