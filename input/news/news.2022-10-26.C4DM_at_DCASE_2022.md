On 3-4 November, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[7th Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE 2022)](https://dcase.community/workshop2022/)</b>.  The workshop aims to provide a venue for researchers working on computational analysis of sound events and scene analysis to present and discuss their results, and is organised in conjunction with the [DCASE 2022 Challenge](https://dcase.community/challenge2022/).

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the workshop, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The below papers presented at DCASE 2022 are authored or co-authored by C4DM members:

* [Few-Shot Bioacoustic Event Detection: Enhanced Classifiers for Prototypical Networks](), by Ren Li, Jinhua Liang, Huy Phan

* [Leveraging label hierarchies for few-shot everyday sound recognition](), by Jinhua Liang, Huy Phan, Emmanouil Benetos

* [Few-shot bioacoustic event detection at the DCASE 2022 challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07911), by Ines Nolasco, Dan Stowell, Vincent Lostanlen, Shubhr Singh, Veronica Morfi, Ari Strandburg-Peshkin, Lisa Gill, Emily Grout, Ester Vidana-Villa, Joe Morford, Michael Emmerson, Frants Jensen, Helen Whitehead, Hanna Pamula, Ivan Kiskin

* [Explaining the decisions of anomalous sound detectors](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/explaining-decisions-anomalous-sound-detectors), by Kimberly T. Mai, Toby Davies, Lewis D. Griffin, Emmanouil Benetos

On challenge organisation, C4DM PhD students [InÃªs Nolasco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C1jftogAAAAJ) and [Shubhr Singh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/singhshubhr.html), QMUL research assistant [Michael Emmerson](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/michael-emmerson.html), C4DM alumna and research visitor [Veronica Morfi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8izRvu4AAAAJ), and C4DM alumnus [Dan Stowell](http://www.mcld.co.uk/research/) are all involved in the organisation of the DCASE 2022 Challenge task on [Few-shot Bioacoustic Event Detection](https://dcase.community/challenge2022/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection), focusing on sound event detection in a few-shot learning setting for animal (mammal and bird) vocalisations.

See you all at DCASE!
