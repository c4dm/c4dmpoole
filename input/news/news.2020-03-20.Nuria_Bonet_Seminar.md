<b>Title</b>: Sonification: A Composer's Point of View

<b>Abstract</b>:
Sonification is the process of data transmission with non-speech audio. While finding increasing acceptance as a scientific method, particularly where a visual representation of data is inadequate, it is still often derided as a ‘gimmick’. Composers have also shown growing interest in sonification as a compositional method. Both in science and in music, the criticism towards this method relates to poor aesthetics and gratuitous applications. My PhD portfolio used sonification as a musical methodology questioning the compositional intent, purpose, musical value and creative processes of a sonification composer. I argue for a more focused use of the method in musical applications in an effort to progress from 'hype' method to 'killer application'.
