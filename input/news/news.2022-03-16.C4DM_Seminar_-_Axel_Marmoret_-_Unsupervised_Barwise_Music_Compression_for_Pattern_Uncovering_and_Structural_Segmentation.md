<b>Title</b>: Unsupervised Barwise Music Compression for Pattern Uncovering and Structural Segmentation

<b>Bio</b>: 
Axel Marmoret, 25 years old, is currently doing a PhD in IRISA, Rennes (France), on the subject of Audio Structural Segmentation.

<b>Abstract</b>:
The first part of this talk will be dedicated to the presentation of Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD), a tensor factorization technique. Applied to barwise representation of a song, NTD is able to uncover barwise audio patterns, in an unsupervised way [1, 2, 3]. These patterns can in turn be used to compose new songs [3], or as a tool for Music Information Retrieval (MIR), as in the context of Structural Segmentation [1,2].
Secondly, the talk will present linear (PCA) and nonlinear (AutoEncoders) compression techniques, applied to barwise representation of music [4]. These compressed representations are studied on the task of Structural Segmentation, where they improve the former state-of-the-art for unsupervised methods, and can achieve the level of performance of supervised state-of-the-art.
Finally, this talk will present recent developments about a new compression paradigm, mixing NTD and AutoEncoders, which could be a new lead for Explainable Deep Learning in MIR.
All of this work is being developed in the context of my PhD.
