<b>Title</b>: AMSS-Net: Audio Manipulation on User-Specified Sources with Textual Queries

<b>Abstract</b>:
It is difficult for non-experts to edit multimedia content such as audio and video. Decreasing the difficulty of audio editing will make more users create, edit, manipulate, and share their audio. This talk will introduce a prototype model called AMSS-Net for a next-generation interface for audio editing. AMSS-Net can perform source-aware audio manipulation according to a given textual query such as 'apply heavy lowpass to vocals, drums'. This talk will also cover relevant future works.

<b>Bio</b>: 
Woosung Choi received his PhD degree from Korea University in 2021.
Currently, he is a postdoctoral visiting fellow at the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), based at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).
He is interested in Machine Learning for audio and speech. Specifically, his research interests include speech enhancement, music source separation, source-aware audio manipulation, and multimodal learning for developing easy-to-use audio editing interfaces.
