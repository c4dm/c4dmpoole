<b>Title</b>: The SpeechBrain Project

<b>Abstract</b>:
SpeechBrain is an open-source and all-in-one conversational AI toolkit. It is designed to facilitate the research and development of speech and language technologies by being simple, flexible, user-friendly, and well-documented. This talk describes the core architecture designed to support several tasks of common interest, allowing users to naturally conceive, compare and share novel conversational AI pipelines. SpeechBrain achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of benchmarks. It also provides training recipes, pretrained models, and inference scripts for popular datasets, as well as tutorials that allow anyone with basic Python proficiency to familiarize themselves with speech technologies. The talk will also discuss the future research direction for this project and share some ideas for the future development of intelligent speaking machines.
