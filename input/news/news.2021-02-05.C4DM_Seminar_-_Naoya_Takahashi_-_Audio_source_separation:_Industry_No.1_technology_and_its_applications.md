<b>Title</b>: Audio source separation: Industry No.1 technology and its applications

<b>Abstract</b>:
Separating sound sources from a mixture has been one of the most challenging problems in the last decades. Sony is a pioneer in developing deep-learning-based source separation methods, and achieved the best scores in a music source separation challenge, Signal Separation Evaluation Challenge (SiSEC), three times in a row. In this talk, I will present recent advances in audio source separation and its applications in Sony products and services.
