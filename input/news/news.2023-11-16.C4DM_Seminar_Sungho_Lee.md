<b>Title</b>: Deep learning meets audio processing graphs

<b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: Musicians and audio engineers sculpt and transform their sounds by connecting multiple processors, forming an audio processing graph. However, most deep-learning methods overlook this real-world practice and assume fixed graph settings. In this talk, we will share our attempts to fill this gap. We will first introduce our recent proof-of-concept, which trains a graph transformer that estimates the original graph (which processors exist, how they connect to others, and what parameter values each processor has) from reference audio. Then, we will outline our recent ongoing extensions, which include efficient computation of arbitrary audio processing graphs on GPU and differentiable search (reverse engineering) of music mixing systems.
