<b>Title</b>: The strange world of speech and audio AI

<b>Abstract</b>:
Audio and speech encompass some of the biggest and most prominent AI fields that exist today - automatic speech recognition, synthesis, analysis, verification, validation, enhancement and transmission. Music compression, generation, analysis, transmission and enhancement. Security monitoring through audio; social and medical applications of sound and speech analysis. It even extends to animal sounds, squeaky engines, damaged pottery and road conditions. There is a lot we can do with audio - unlike video it works in the dark, travels around corners and past blocking objects, is low bandwidth, and low energy. In AI terms, it is usually uniformly sampled one dimensional time series information but is often transformed to two-dimensional input feature representations. This seminar will overview much of the wide range of AI applications for speech and audio, and delve into several specific areas to examine machine learning architectures, and how they compare.
