Last weekend saw the [139th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society](http://www.aes.org/events/139/) in Javits Convention Center in New York City. The annual American AES Convention is the world's main event for all things audio, spanning a wide range of topics including loudspeaker design, music production, hearing aids, game audio and perception, and featuring a huge trade show as opposed to its less industry-heavy annual European counterparts. 

A handful of C4DM delegates (**Joshua D. Reiss**, **György Fazekas**, **Thomas Wilmering**, **David Moffat**, **David Ronan**, and **Brecht De Man**) were each involved in multiple sessions. 

#### Papers

T. Wilmering, G. Fazekas, Alo Allik and Mark B. Sandler, ["Audio Effects Data on the Semantic Web"](http://www.aes.org/events/139/papers/?ID=4556)
[[Download paper](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?conv=139&papernum=9456)]

D. Ronan, B. De Man, H. Gunes and J. D. Reiss, ["The Impact of Subgrouping Practices on the Perception of Multitrack Music Mixes"](http://www.aes.org/events/139/papers/?ID=4553)

**Dave Ronan** also presented at the Student Design Exhibition with a physical model of a sitar based on a dynamic delay line and the Karplus-Strong model. 

#### Workshops and tutorials

Workshop W20: "[Perceptual Evaluation of High Resolution Audio](http://www.aes.org/events/139/workshops/?ID=4687)" (**Joshua D. Reiss** (chair), Bob Katz, George Massenburg and Bob Schulein) 

Tutorial T21: "[Advances in Semantic Audio and Intelligent Music Production](http://www.aes.org/events/139/tutorials/?ID=4724)" (Ryan Stables (chair), **Joshua D. Reiss**, **Brecht De Man** and **Thomas Wilmering**)

Workshop W26: "[Application of Semantic Audio Analysis to the Music Production Workflow](http://www.aes.org/events/139/workshops/?ID=4703)" (**György Fazekas** (co-chair), Ryan Stables (co-chair), Jay LeBoeuf and Bryan Pardo)

#### Other events

**Brecht De Man** and **Dave Moffat** were responsible for the organisation of the entire [Student and Career Development track](http://www.aes.org/events/139/students/) as the Chair and Vice Chair of the Student Delegate Assembly (Europe and International Regions). These events include a student party (this edition at NYU's [James L. Dolan's Music Recording Studio](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology/facilities/studios/6th_floor)), Student Recording Competition, Student Design Competition, and a very successful edition of the Education and Career Fair. 

**Dave Ronan** represented Queen Mary at the latter, discussing the various taught and research courses with an emphasis on the new MSc in Sound and Music Computing and handing out a lot of QM swag. 

#### Committees
**[High Resolution Audio](http://www.aes.org/technical/hra/) Technical Committee**: Josh

**[Semantic Audio Analysis](http://www.aes.org/technical/saa/) Technical Committee**: György and Thomas

**Education Committee**: Dave Moffat and Brecht

Josh also serves as a member of the Board of Governors of the AES.
