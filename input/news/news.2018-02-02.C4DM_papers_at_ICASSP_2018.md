title: Many C4DM papers accepted for ICASSP 2018
------------------

C4DM researchers have had a lot of success this year in being accepted for [ICASSP 2018](https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/),
the IEEE's International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing. 
Most of these papers are led by C4DM PhD students, on MIR and Machine Listening topics:
