<b>Title</b>: High-resolution piano transcription system andGiantMIDI-Piano dataset

<b>Abstract</b>:
The joint research of artificialintelligence (AI) and music has been a popular research area in recent years.AI and music have valuable applications in both academia and industry,including music recommendation, production and automatic generation. Musictranscription is a fundamental task in AI based music tasks, which aims attranscribing audio recordings into symbolic representations. This work proposeda high-resolution piano transcription system including transcribing piano notesand sustain-pedals. All of onset, offsets and velocities information aretranscribed. Using this piano transcription system, we created aGiantMIDI-Piano dataset including 10,854 unique automatically transcribed pianoMIDI files. We analyzed the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset and show musical analysisof some classical music pieces. GiantMIDI-Piano dataset can be used but notlimited to automatic music generation and musical analysis.
