title: C4DM at DAFx15

-------------------

The DAFx conference began with a tutorial day, where Peter Svensson provided a fantastic summary of the State of the Art in sound field propagation modelling and virtual acoustics.

During lunch, as it was getting dark, the snow started, which unfortunately blocked our view on the Northern Lights that afternoon. Øyvind Brandtsegg & Trond Engum then discussed Cross adaptive digital audio effects and their creative use in live performance. He referenced existing work at Queen Mary as some of the state of the art in existing work, and then presented NUTU’s current work on Cross Adaptive Audio Effects. The workshop day was rounded off with Xavier Serra discussing the Audio Commons project and use of open audio content.

Day two opened with Marije Baalmans keynote on the range of hardware and software audio effects and synthesisers are available to artists, and how different artists utilise these effects. This talk was focused primarily on small embedded systems that artists use, such as Arduino, Beaglebone Black and Raspberry Pi. Later in the day, some excellent work including 

* [Granular Synthesis was presented by Sadjad Siddiq from Square Enix](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_7.pdf/e66b153c-1b7b-4c29-b13c-83197d5c7c92)
* [A collaboration on synthesising Percussive Drilling Sounds, between IRCAM and HUT](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_4.pdf/d0e8cd6c-af41-4303-a81b-1c35d78ab5eb)
* [Using a modal reverberator structure to modify samples from CCRMA](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_72.pdf/6940422d-a958-4698-b861-4aea48a615ee)
* [Work on intelligent multitrack audio subgrouping by Dave Ronan from C4DM](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_19_v2.pdf/4f6d9373-5c7f-465a-b083-9f6f8587ff98)

Day three began with an excellent introduction and summary of Wave Digital filters and Digital Wave Guides by Kurt Werner and Julius O. Smith from CCRMA, in which the current state of the art in physical modelling no nonlinearities was presented and some potential avenues for future exploration was discussed. Following on from this work was discussed regarding 

* [Identification of metrical structure of music, by Elio from C4DM](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_41_final.pdf/8d8a028d-3e77-4e6e-b4d8-6c0cae12aefd)
* [Research on whether computer games noticeably prefer spatial audio, from York University](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_35.pdf/12202144-c7e5-41c6-a119-c71f53edc603)
* [An approac to efficient estimations of non-linear components, by Giulio from C4DM](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_68.pdf/6c4dbece-fd6e-4efb-a0f4-2864dbd80a43)

* [An evaluation of feature extraction toolboxes by Dave Moffat from C4DM (Honourable Mention for Best Paper Award)](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_43_v2.pdf/06508f48-9272-41c8-9381-7639a0240770)
* [Work on vocal tract modelling from York, PPCU Budapest and KTH Sweden ](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_32.pdf/34a3cec5-9f6b-47f7-ba6b-4ab7bd2ce4cb).

The final days of the conference started with Franz Zotters keynote on Ambisonic Audio Effects and spatialisation of audio. The following presentation session on audio coding including [optimisation of audio latency for Android](http://www.ntnu.edu/documents/1001201110/1266017954/DAFx-15_submission_29.pdf/c20ccc4f-1262-42ae-af5f-4a0b1305d142), some interesting work on virtual analog and physical modelling systems. The session finished with an introduction to DAFx16, which will be hosted in Brno, Czech Republic in September.
