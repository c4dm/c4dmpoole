title: C4DM at the ISMIR 2015 conference

-------------------

Last week saw the <b>[16th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2015)](http://ismir2015.uma.es/)</b>, which took place in Malaga, Spain. ISMIR is the leading conference in the field of music informatics, and is currently the [top ranking publication in terms of h-index for Music & Musicology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=hum_musicmusicology&venue=XBwMiZEPey4J.2014) (source: Google Scholar).

Queen Mary University of London, and more specifically its Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), had as in previous years a strong presence in the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact.

On <b>Tutorials</b>, the following were co-organised by C4DM members:
* [Why singing is interesting (Simon Dixon, Masataka Goto, Matthias Mauch)](http://ismir2015.uma.es/tutorialschedule.html#tutorial1)
* [Automatic music transcription (Zhiyao Duan, Emmanouil Benetos)](http://ismir2015.uma.es/tutorialschedule.html#tutorial6)

On <b>Keynotes</b>, Prof. Mark Sandler gave a talk on ["Integrating music information sources for music production and consumption"](http://ismir2015.uma.es/keynotespeakers.html#keynote1).
