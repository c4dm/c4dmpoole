On 22-25 October, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[2023 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics](http://www.waspaa.com/)</b>, taking place at the Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, NY, USA. WASPAA is a premier event in the field of audio signal processing, organised by the IEEE's Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing (AASP) technical committee, with a strong focus on music signal processing and computational sound scene analysis.

The Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), as in previous years, will have a strong presence at WASPAA 2023.

In the <b>Technical Programme</b>, the following papers are authored by C4DM members:

* [Perceptual Musical Similarity Metric Learning with Graph Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10248151) (Cyrus Vahidi, Shubhr Singh, George Fazekas, Emmanouil Benetos, Dan Stowell, Huy Phan, Mathieu Lagrange) [Postprint](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/90297)
* [Annotating Jazz Recordings using Lead Sheet Alignment with Deep Chroma Features](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10248107/) (Ivan Shanin, Simon Dixon) [Postprint](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/90038)
* [Leveraging synthetic data for improving chamber ensemble separation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/waspaa58266.2023.10248118) (Saurjya Sarkar, Louise Thorpe, Emmanouil Benetos, Mark B Sandler) [Postprint](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/89844)
* [General Purpose Audio Effect Removal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10248157/) (Matthew Rice, Christian J. Steinmetz, George Fazekas, Joshua D. Reiss) [Postprint](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/91026)

In the <b>Demo Session</b>, the following demos will be presented by C4DM members:
