title: C4DM papers at CMMR 2021

---

On 15-19 November 2021, several C4DM researchers will participate virtually at the [15th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR)](https://www.cmmr2021.gttm.jp/). CMMR focuses on interdisciplinary aspects related to the role of human interaction in musical practice, perceptual and cognitive aspects linked to sound modelling and how sense or meaning can be transmitted either from isolated sounds or musical structure as a whole.

The following papers authored/co-authored by C4DM members will be presented:
