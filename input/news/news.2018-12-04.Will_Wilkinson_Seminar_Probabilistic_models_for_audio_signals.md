<b>Title</b>: Probabilistic models for audio signals - an intro via time-frequency analysis

<b>Abstract</b>:
For all their proclaimed benefits, probabilistic models are yet to take
off in the signal processing community. But we are inching ever closer to
the point at which specifying a probability distribution over an audio
signal will be practical and useful. In signal processing we are interested in
modelling functions of time, and Gaussian processes offer a principled way
to specify distributions over functions whilst also encoding prior knowledge.
In this seminar I’ll demonstrate how Gaussian processes provide a
means through which to interpret existing models for time-frequency analysis,
and to construct new models. The probabilistic framework allows us
to adapt our time-frequency representation to a signal, quantify uncertainty 
about predictions, and generate new audio signals from the learnt
distribution that maintain the correct amplitude and phase relationship.
