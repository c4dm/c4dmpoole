Conventional instruments are designed with non-disabled people in mind. If a person’s impairment is such that they cannot play a musical instrument, then they face an access barrier to music making and they are disabled. Drake Music believe that good musical instrument design can remove this barrier, allowing disabled musicians to develop deep and lasting artistic practice and careers.

There are only six widely available solutions for accessible music-making. In contrast, an orchestra is made up of at least nineteen instrument types, rock and pop frequently uses four or more types and the instruments used in world, electronic, jazz and folk musics add up to a rich and diverse pallet of choice for most aspiring and professional musicians. This disparity needs to be bridged, in particular with the development of more expressive musical instruments for those facing barriers to music-making.

In this lecture I will talk about how good design can remove access barriers to music making for disabled people and level the playing field. I will demonstrate existing music technology that we use in schools, and demonstrate and give examples of successes from Drake Music’s DMLab programme, which supports innovation in accessible musical instrument design, and explore the barriers and opportunities we face in pushing this important area of research and community practice forward.

Music is a powerful storytelling medium, and if, as a culture, we are excluding one section of society from storytelling, we are not hearing the full artistic output of our society.

Historically, disabled musicians and artists have not been a part of the cultural mainstream. Our project seeks to increase the awareness and understanding of the quality of the creative practice of disabled musicians and create instruments that level the playing field for opportunity, aspiration, collaboration and audience development.

Gawain has passion for community music which is driven from a belief that all people should be making music, and a strong belief in the power of music to drive social change, both for the individual and the community as a whole.
