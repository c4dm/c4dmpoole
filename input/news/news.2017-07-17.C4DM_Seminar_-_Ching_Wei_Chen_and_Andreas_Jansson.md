Ching-Wei Chen and Andreas Jansson

<span style="font-size: 130%;">Abstract</span></br>
Ching-Wei will begin the talk with an introduction of Spotify's music personalization features, such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar, with a brief mention of some Machine Learning and Audio Analysis technologies being used behind the scenes. Andreas will then continue with a presentation of his recent work in vocal separation:

The decomposition of a music audio signal into its vocal and backing track components is analogous to image-to-image translation, where a mixed spectrogram is trans-formed into its constituent sources. We propose a novel application of the U-Net architecture — initially developed for medical imaging — for the task of source separation, given its proven capacity for recreating the fine, low-level detail required for high-quality audio reproduction. The model is trained on a large set of data automatically derived from the Spotify commercial music catalogue.
