**1st Speaker:** Yin-Jyun Luo

<b>Title</b>: Learning Disentangled Representations of Timbre and Pitch for Musical Instrument Sounds Using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders

<b>Abstract</b>:
In this talk, I will share our empirical results on learning disentangled representations using Gaussian mixture variational autoencoders (GMVAEs) for music instrument sounds. Specifically, we achieve disentanglement of note timbre and pitch, respectively, represented as latent timbre and pitch variables, by learning separate neural network encoders. The distributions of the two latent variables are regularized by distinct Gaussian mixture distributions. A neural network decoder is used to synthesize sounds with the desired timbre and pitch, which takes a concatenation of the timbre and pitch variables as input. The performance of the disentanglement network is evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative approaches, which further demonstrate the model's applicability in both controllable sound synthesis and many-to-many timbre transfer.

**2nd Speaker:** Kin Wai Cheuk

<b>Title</b>: nnAudio: a GPU audio processing tool and its application to music transcription.

<b>Abstract</b>:
I will present a recently released neural-network based audio processing toolbox called nnAudio. This toolbox leverages 1D convolutional neural networks for real-time spectrogram generation (time-domain to frequency-domain conversion). This enables us to generate spectrograms on-the-fly without the need to store any of the spectrograms on the disk when training neural networks for audio related tasks. In this talk, I will discuss one of the possible applications of nnAudio, namely, the exploration of suitable input representations for automatic music transcription (AMT).
