title: New tools for Vamp plugin and host developers
----------------

C4DM announces new releases of three tools of interest to developers of [Vamp audio
feature extraction plugins and hosts](http://vamp-plugins.org):


##Vamp Plugin Tester v1.1

An essential tool to test your Vamp plugin for common problems before
you release it. The tester is a host that knows how to load a plugin,
run 20 different categories of test on it, and give diagnostic warnings
and errors.
