The Digital Music Research Network (DMRN) aims to promote research in the area of Digital Music, by bringing together researchers from UK and overseas universities and industry for its annual workshop. The workshop will include invited and contributed talks and posters. The workshop will be an ideal opportunity for networking with other people working in the area. 

 
<b>Call for Contributions</b>

You are invited to submit a proposal for a "talk" and/or a "poster" to be presented at this event.

TALKS may range from the latest research, through research overviews or surveys, to opinion pieces or position statements, particularly those likely to be of interest to an interdisciplinary audience. We plan to keep talks to about 10 minutes each, depending on the number of submissions.

POSTERS can be on any research topic of interest to the members of the network. Posters will be displayed on the venue hall during coffees and lunch break.

The abstracts of presentations will be collated into a digest and distributed on the day.

 

<b>Submission</b>

Please prepare your talk or poster proposal in the form of an abstract (1 page A4, using the template available from the DMRN+17 web page). Submit it via email to <a href="mailto:dmrn@lists.eecs.qmul.ac.uk">dmrn@lists.eecs.qmul.ac.uk</a> giving the following information about your presentation:
