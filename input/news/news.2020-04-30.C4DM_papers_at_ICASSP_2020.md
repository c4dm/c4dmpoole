<p><img src="/news/images/ICASSP-2020-logo.png" width="50%" /></p>

On 4-8 May 2020, several C4DM researchers will participate virtually at the <b>[IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020)](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/)</b>. ICASSP is the flagship conference of the IEEE's Signal Processing Society and is the leading conference in the field of signal processing. For this year, ICASSP is organised as a virtual conference offering [free registration](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/registration/) to attendees.

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The following papers authored/co-authored by C4DM members will be presented:
