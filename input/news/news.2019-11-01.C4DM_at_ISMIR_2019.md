On 4-8 November, several C4DM researchers will participate at the <b>[20th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2019)](https://ismir2019.ewi.tudelft.nl/)</b>, taking place in Delft, The Netherlands. ISMIR is the leading conference in the field of music informatics, and is currently the [top cited publication for Music & Musicology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=hum_musicmusicology) (source: Google Scholar).

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact.

As part of the <b>20th ISMIR anniversary special session</b>, the following paper from C4DM will be presented:

* [20 Years of Automatic Chord Recognition from Audio](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000004.pdf) (Johan Pauwels, Ken O'Hanlon, Emilia Gomez, Mark B. Sandler)

In the <b>Technical Programme</b>, the following papers are authored/co-authored by C4DM members:

* [Blending Acoustic and Language Model Predictions for Automatic Music Transcription](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000054.pdf) (Adrien Ycart, Andrew McLeod, Emmanouil Benetos, Kazuyoshi Yoshii)
* [A Comparative Study of Neural Models for Polyphonic Music Sequence Transduction](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000056.pdf) (Adrien Ycart, Daniel Stoller, Emmanouil Benetos)
* [Automatic Music Transcription and Ethnomusicology: a User Study](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000082.pdf) (Andre Holzapfel, Emmanouil Benetos)
* [Adaptive Time-Frequency Scattering for Periodic Modulation Recognition in Music Signals](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000099.pdf) (Changhong Wang, Emmanouil Benetos, Vincent Lostanlen, Elaine Chew)

For the <b>[MIREX 2019](https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2019:MIREX2019_Results)</b> public evaluations, the following submissions were made from C4DM:

* ["MIREX 2019: VAMP Plugins from the Centre for Digital Music"](https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/abstracts/2019/CB1.pdf) (Chris Cannam, Emmanouil Benetos, Matthias Mauch, Matthew E. P. Davies, Simon Dixon, Christian Landone, Mark Levy, Matthias Mauch, Katy Noland, and Dan Stowell). Participated in the following tasks: Audio Beat Tracking, Audio Key Detection, Audio Chord Estimation, Audio Onset Detection, Multiple Fundamental Frequency Estimation and Tracking, Structural Segmentation, Audio Tempo Estimation. 
* ["Polyphonic music sequence classification with LSTM networks"](https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/abstracts/2019/YB2.pdf) (Adrien Ycart and Emmanouil Benetos). Participated in the Patterns for Prediction task.

For the <b>[Demos & Late-Breaking News](http://ismir2015.uma.es/demosandlate.html)</b> session, the following submissions were authored/co-authored by C4DM members:
