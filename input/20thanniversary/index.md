Events
------------------
**WORK IN PROGRESS:** (21st June)

Our work in progress events aim to give students of the MAT, AIM and SMC programmes an opportunity to present their (unfinished) works and ideas in a laid-back, zero-pressure environment. All students are encouraged present their own work and join in, sonically or visually: there will be instruments and a PA setup as well as some projectors, and possibly some a jam sessions happening after the performances. 

Details to follow.



**SYMPOSIUM:** (22nd June)

Talks from C4DM alumni across the years...

* Adam Stark
* Becky Stewart
* Di Mainstone
* Juan Pablo Bello

Followed by a closing panel on the future of C4DM! Tea and coffee available at key points i.e arrival, lunch and then possibly an afternoon break.
