Events
------------------
**WORK IN PROGRESS:** (21st June)

Our work in progress events aim to give students of the MAT, AIM and SMC programmes an opportunity to present their (unfinished) works and ideas in a laid-back, zero-pressure environment. All students are encouraged present their own work and join in, sonically or visually: there will be instruments and a PA setup as well as some projectors, and possibly some a jam sessions happening after the performances. 

Details to follow.
