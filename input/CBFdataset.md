title: CBFdataset: A Dataset of Chinese Bamboo Flute Performances
--------------------

## Content

CBFdataset is a dataset of Chinese bamboo flute (CBF) performances, created for ecologically valid analysis of music playing techniques in context.

The dataset comprises monophonic recordings of classic CBF pieces and isolated playing techniques, recorded by 10 professional CBF performers; and expert annotations of seven playing techniques: vibrato, tremolo, trill, flutter-tongue, acciaccatura, portamento, and glissando. The recorded pieces include *Busy Delivering Harvest* <扬鞭催马运粮忙>, *Jolly Meeting* <喜相逢>, *Morning* <早晨>, and *Flying Partridge* <鹧鸪飞>. All data was recorded in a professional recording studio using a Zoom H6 recorder at 44.1kHz/24-bits. 

## Download
