<h2>CBFdataset: A Dataset of Chinese Bamboo Flute Performances</h2>

<h3>
Content
</h3>

<p>
The CBFdataset is created for ecologically valid analysis of playing techniques in real-world music performances. The dataset contains monophonic recordings of representative CBF playing techniques and classic CBF pieces recorded and annotated by professional players. The CBFdataset includes three subsets: CBF-periDB, CBF-petsDB, and CBF-piexDB.
</p>

<p>
(1) <b>CBF-periDB</b>: a dataset for periodic modulation analysis. This dataset contains recordings of four types of isolated playing techniques–vibrato, tremolo, trill, and flutter-tongue–and twenty full-length pieces recorded and annotated by ten professional players.
</p>
<p>
(2) <b>CBF-petsDB</b>: a dataset for pitch evolution-based playing techniques (pets) analysis. This dataset contains recordings of three types of isolated playing techniques–acciacatura, portamento, and glissando–and twenty full-length pieces recorded and annotated by ten professional players.
</p>
<p>
(3) <b>CBF-piexDB</b>: piece expanded (piex) CBFdataset with more than forty additional pieces different from the pieces in CBF-periDB and CBF-petsDB.
