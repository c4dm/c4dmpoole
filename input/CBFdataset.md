# CBFdataset: A Dataset of Chinese Bamboo Flute Performances</h2>

## Content

The CBFdataset is created for ecologically valid analysis of playing techniques in real-world music performances. The dataset contains monophonic recordings of classic CBF pieces and expert playing technique annotations, including two subsets:

(1) **CBF-periDB**: a subset for periodic modulation analysis. It comprises full-length pieces and annotations of four types of periodic modulations: vibratos, tremolos, trills, and flutter-tongue. 

(2) **CBF-petsDB**: a subset for pitch evolution-based playing techniques (pets) analysis. It includes full-length pieces and annotations of three types of PETs: acciaccatura, portamento, and glissando.

## Download

All the recordings and annotations in the CBFdataset can be downloaded at [zenodo.org/record/3776864](https://zenodo.org/record/3776864).
