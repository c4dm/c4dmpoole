The most widely-used software tools from C4DM are **[Sonic Visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/)**, **[aubio](http://aubio.org/)**, and **[Tony](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/tony)**.

A large part of our research is converted into **[Vamp plugins](https://www.vamp-plugins.org/download.html)**, which are compatible with Sonic Visualiser and Audacity across several operating systems.

Other C4DM software is available on **[isophonics.org](http://isophonics.org/)** and our previous **[download page](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/downloads/)**.

We also run the [**SoundSoftware** code repository](http://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/) which hosts software projects for audio and music researchers.

Finally, we maintain a **[C4DM group in GitHub](https://github.com/c4dm/)**, hosting public-facing code releases from the group.

Datasets
-------

Our **[C4DM Zenodo community page](https://zenodo.org/communities/c4dm/)** hosts public datasets created as part of our research. 

The **[C4DM Research Data Repository](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/rdr/)** hosts datasets created between 2010-2015.

Several C4DM datasets are also available on **[isophonics.org](http://isophonics.org/)** .
