  abstract = {This research explored the relations between the predictability of musical structure, expressive timing in performance, and listeners' perceived musical tension. Studies analyzing the influence of expressive timing on listeners' affective responses have been constrained by the fact that, in most pieces, the notated durations limit performers' interpretive freedom. To circumvent this issue, we focused on the unmeasured prelude, a semi-improvisatory genre without notated durations. In Experiment 1, 12 professional harpsichordists recorded an unmeasured prelude on a harpsichord equipped with a MIDI console. Melodic expectation was assessed using a probabilistic model (IDyOM [Information Dynamics of Music]) whose expectations have been previously shown to match closely those of human listeners. Performance timing information was extracted from the MIDI data using a score-performance matching algorithm. Time-series analyses showed that, in a piece with unspecified note durations, the predictability of melodic structure measurably influenced tempo fluctuations in performance. In Experiment 2, another 10 harpsichordists, 20 nonharpsichordist musicians, and 20 nonmusicians listened to the recordings from Experiment 1 and rated the perceived tension continuously. Granger causality analyses were conducted to investigate predictive relations among melodic expectation, expressive timing, and perceived tension. Although melodic expectation, as modeled by IDyOM, modestly predicted perceived tension for all participant groups, neither of its components, information content or entropy, was Granger causal. In contrast, expressive timing was a strong predictor and was Granger causal. However, because melodic expectation was also predictive of expressive timing, our results outline a complete chain of influence from predictability of melodic structure via expressive performance timing to perceived musical tension.

In an effort to consolidate research in the field, we characterize neuroaesthetics as the cognitive neuroscience of aesthetic experience, drawing on long traditions of research in empirical aesthetics on the one hand and cognitive neuroscience on the other. We clarify the aims and scope of the field, identifying relations among neuroscientific investigations of aesthetics, beauty, and art. The approach we advocate takes as its object of study a wide spectrum of aesthetic experiences, resulting from interactions of individuals, sensory stimuli, and context. Drawing on its parent fields, a cognitive neuroscience of aesthetics would investigate the complex cognitive processes and functional networks of brain regions involved in those experiences without placing a value on them. Thus, the cognitive neuroscientific approach may develop in a way that is mutually complementary to approaches in the humanities.},

  abstract = {This paper is about the Mobile Audio Ontology, a semantic audio framework for the design of novel music consumption experiences on mobile devices. The framework is based on the concept of the Dynamic Music Object which is an amalgamation of audio files, structural and analytical information extracted from the audio, and information about how it should be rendered in realtime. The Mobile Audio Ontology allows producers and distributors to specify a great variety of ways of playing back music in controlled indeterministic as well as adaptive and interactive ways. Users can map mobile sensor data, user interface controls, or autonomous control units hidden from the listener to any musical parameter exposed in the definition of a Dynamic Music Object. These mappings can also be made dependent on semantic and analytical information extracted from the audio.},

  abstract = {© 2016 ACM.The field of computational creativity, including musical metacreation, strives to develop artificial systems that are capable of demonstrating creative behavior or producing creative artefacts. But the claim of creativity is often assessed, subjectively only on the part of the researcher and not objectively at all. This article provides theoretical motivation for more systematic evaluation of musical metacreation and computationally creative systems and presents an overview of current methods used to assess human and machine creativity that may be adapted for this purpose. In order to highlight the need for a varied set of evaluation tools, a distinction is drawn among three types of creative systems: those that are purely generative, those that contain internal or external feedback, and those that are capable of reflection and self-reflection. To address the evaluation of each of these aspects, concrete examples of methods and techniques are suggested to help researchers (1) evaluate their systems' creative process and generated artefacts, and test their impact on the perceptual, cognitive, and affective states of the audience, and (2) build mechanisms for reflection into the creative system, including models of human perception and cognition, to endow creative systems with internal evaluative mechanisms to drive self-reflective processes. The first type of evaluation can be considered external to the creative system and may be employed by the researcher to both better understand the efficacy of their system and its impact and to incorporate feedback into the system. Here we take the stance that understanding human creativity can lend insight to computational approaches, and knowledge of how humans perceive creative systems and their output can be incorporated into artificial agents as feedback to provide a sense of how a creation will impact the audience. The second type centers around internal evaluation, in which the system is able to reason about its own behavior and generated output. We argue that creative behavior cannot occur without feedback and reflection by the creative/metacreative system itself. More rigorous empirical testing will allow computational and metacreative systems to become more creative by definition and can be used to demonstrate the impact and novelty of particular approaches.},

We then investigate whether these properties can be measured in terms of geometric features of a model of distributional lexical semantics. We compare the performance of two models, our own Concept Discovery Model which dynamically constructs context-sensitive subspaces, and a state-of-the-art static distributional semantic model, and find that our dynamic model performs significantly better in its measurement of metaphoricity.},

identify and describe high-level attributes in music audio signals 
continues to be an elusive goal,
but one that surely has broad and deep implications 
for a wide variety of applications.
Hundreds of papers have so far been published toward this goal,
and great progress appears to have been made.
Some systems produce remarkable accuracies 
at recognising high-level semantic concepts, such as music style, genre and mood.
However, it might be that these numbers do not mean what they seem.
In this paper, we take a state-of-the-art music content analysis system
and investigate what causes it to achieve
exceptionally high performance in a benchmark music audio dataset.
We dissect the system to understand its operation,
determine its sensitivities and limitations, and predict the kinds of knowledge
it could and could not possess about music.
We perform a series of experiments 
to illuminate what the system has actually learned to do,
and to what extent it is performing the intended music listening task.
Our results demonstrate how the initial manifestation of 
music intelligence in this state-of-the-art can be deceptive.
Our work provides constructive directions toward 
developing music content analysis systems that 
can address the music information and creation needs of real-world users.},

We first analyse the feature extraction and classification components of scattering-based MCA systems. This guides us to perform intervention experiments on three factors: train/test partition, classifier and recording spectrum. The partition intervention shows a decrease in the amount of reproduced ground truth by the resulting systems. We then replace the learning algorithm with a binary decision tree, and identify the impact of specific feature dimensions. We finally alter the spectral content related to such dimensions, which reveals that these scattering-based systems exploit acoustic information below 20 Hz to reproduce GTZAN ground truth. The source code to reproduce our experiments is available online.},

  abstract = {Animals in groups often exchange calls, in patterns whose temporal structure may be influenced by contextual factors such as physical location and the social network structure of the group. We introduce a model-based analysis for temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the next, and that “kernels” reflecting the temporal range of influence have a characteristic structure for a calling individual’s effect on itself, its partner, and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of influences by call type as well as by individual.},

By applying hierarchical clustering to the audio feature space, we show that similarity in term representations exists within and between transformation classes. Furthermore, the organisation of terms in low-dimensional timbre space can be explained using perceptual concepts such as size and dissonance. We conclude by performing Latent Semantic Indexing to show that similar groupings exist based on term frequency.},

This research involved a systematic review and meta-analysis (combining the results of numerous independent studies) to assess the ability of test subjects to perceive a difference between high resolution and standard (16 bit, 44.1 or 48 kHz) audio. Eighteen published experiments for which sufficient data could be obtained were included, providing a meta-analysis that combined over 400 participants in more than 12,500 trials. Results showed a small but statistically significant ability of test subjects to discriminate high resolution content, and this effect increased dramatically when test subjects received extensive training. This result was verified by a sensitivity analysis exploring different choices for the chosen studies and different analysis approaches. Potential biases in studies, effect of test methodology, experimental design, and choice of stimuli were also investigated. The overall conclusion is that the perceived fidelity of an audio recording and playback chain can be affected by operating beyond conventional resolution.},

The time-frequency (T-F) processing enables exploitation of the nonstationarity and sparsity of audio signals, increasing robustness to multiple sources and ambient noise. For inter-channel phase difference estimation, we use a cost function, which is equivalent to the generalized cross correlation with phase transform (GCC) algorithm and which is robust to spatial aliasing caused by large inter-microphone distances. To estimate the number of sources, we further propose an iterative contribution removal (ICR) algorithm to count and locate the sources using the peaks of the GCC function. In each iteration, we first use IPD to calculate the GCC function, whose highest peak is detected as the location of a sound source; then we detect the T-F bins that are associated with this source and remove them from the IPD set. The proposed ICR algorithm successfully solves the GCC peak ambiguities between multiple sources and multiple reverberant paths.},

A major challenge is that the TDOAs contain unknown time offsets between asynchronous sensors. To address this problem, we propose a low-rank approximation method that does not need any prior knowledge of sensor and source locations or timing information. At first, we construct a pseudo time of arrival (TOA) matrix by introducing two sets of unknown timing parameters (source onset times and device capture times) into the current TDOA matrix. Then we propose a Gauss-Newton low-rank approximation algorithm to jointly identify the two sets of unknown timing parameters, exploiting the low-rank property embedded in the pseudo TOA matrix. We derive the boundaries of the timing parameters to reduce the initialization space and employ a multi-initialization scheme. Finally, we use the estimated timing parameters to correct the pseudo TOA matrix, which is further applied to sensor and source localization. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

As such,it constitutes a kind of predictive coding, with a particular novel hypothetical implementation. Here, we focus on the model’s mechanism for predicting when a perceptual event will happen, given an existing sequence of past events, which maybe musical or linguistic. We propose a range of tests to validate or falsify the model, at various different levels of abstraction, and argue that computational modelling in particular, and this model in particular, can offer a means of providing limited but useful evidence for evolutionary hypotheses.},

Sensitivity to patterns is fundamental to sensory processing, in particular in the auditory system, because most auditory signals only have meaning as successions over time. Previous evidence suggests that the brain is tuned to the statistics of sensory stimulation. However, the process through which this arises has been elusive. We demonstrate that listeners are remarkably sensitive to the emergence of complex patterns within rapidly evolving sound sequences, performing on par with an ideal observer model. Brain responses reveal online processes of evidence accumulation--dynamic changes in tonic activity precisely correlate with the expected precision or predictability of ongoing auditory input--both in terms of deterministic (first-order) structure and the entropy of random sequences. Source analysis demonstrates an interaction between primary auditory cortex, hippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus in the process of discovering the regularity within the ongoing sound sequence. The results are consistent with precision based predictive coding accounts of perceptual inference and provide compelling neurophysiological evidence of the brain's capacity to encode high-order temporal structure in sensory signals.},

This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms ± 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

This paper examines several common configurations where a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino) or wireless device communicates with computer-based sound generator (e.g. Max/MSP, Pd). We find that, perhaps surprisingly, almost none of the tested configurations meet generally-accepted guidelines for latency and jitter. To address this limitation, the paper presents a new embedded platform, Bela, which is capable of complex audio and sensor processing at submillisecond latency.},

Audience members' physical movements provide one possible source of information about their engagement with a performance. Using a case study of the dance performance "Frames" that took place in Theatre Royal in Glasgow during March 2015, we examine patterns of audience movement during contemporary dance performances and explore how they relate to the dancer's movements. Video recordings of performers and audience were analysed using computer vision and data analysis techniques extracting facial expression, hand gestural and body movement data. We found that during the performance audiences move very little and have predominantly expressionless faces while hand gestures seem to play a significant role in the way audiences respond. This suggests that stillness i.e. the absence of motion may be an indicator of engagement.},

Despite significant interest within the research community, several studies have reported on a 'glass ceiling' effect, an apparent limit on the transcription accuracy that current methods seem incapable of overcoming. In this paper, we explore how much this effect can be mitigated by focusing on a specific instrument class and making use of additional information on the recording conditions available in studio or home recording scenarios. In particular, exploiting the availability of single note recordings for the instrument in use, we develop a novel signal model employing variable-length spectro-temporal patterns as its central building blocks - tailored for pitched percussive instruments such as the piano. Temporal dependencies between spectral templates are modeled, resembling characteristics of factorial scaled hidden Markov models (FS-HMM) and other methods combining nonnegative matrix factorization with Markov processes. In contrast to FS-HMMs, our parameter estimation is developed in a global, relaxed form within the extensible alternating direction method of multipliers framework, which enables the systematic combination of basic regularizers propagating sparsity and local stationarity in note activity with more complex regularizers imposing temporal semantics. The proposed method achieves an f -measure of 93-95\% for note onsets on pieces recorded on a Yamaha Disklavier (MAPS DB).},

Using supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques we learn feature representations for music similarity. We evaluate how well music styles separate in this learned space with a classification experiment. We obtained moderate performance classifying the recordings by country. Analysis of misclassifications revealed cases of geographical or cultural proximity. We further evaluate the learned space by detecting outliers, i.e. identifying recordings that stand out in the collection. We use a data mining technique based on Mahalanobis distances to detect outliers and perform a listening experiment in the ‘odd one out’ style to evaluate our findings. We are able to detect, amongst others, recordings of non-musical content as outliers as well as music with distinct timbral and harmonic content. The listening experiment reveals moderate agreement between subjects’ ratings and our outlier estimation.},

Transcription is performed in a supervised way, with the training and test datasets produced by the same piano. First we train parameters for the attack and decay components on isolated notes, then update only the note activations for transcription. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 82\% on note-wise and 79\% on frame-wise F-measures on the ‘ENSTDkCl’ subset of the MAPS database, outperforming the current published state of the art.},

Despite considerable improvements in recent years, state-of-the-art methods still often fail to identify a correct alignment if versions differ substantially with respect to acoustic conditions or musical interpretation. To increase the robustness for these cases, we exploit in this work the availability of multiple versions of the piece to be aligned. By processing these jointly, we can supply the alignment process with additional examples of how a section might be interpreted or which acoustic conditions may arise. This way, we can use alignment information between two versions transitively to stabilize the alignment with a third version. Extending our previous work [1], we present two such joint alignment methods, progressive alignment and probabilistic profile, and discuss their fundamental differences and similarities on an algorithmic level. Our systematic experiments using 376 recordings of 9 pieces demonstrate that both methods can indeed improve the alignment accuracy and robustness over comparable pairwise methods. Further, we provide an in-depth analysis of the behavior of both joint alignment methods, studying the influence of parameters such as the number of performances available, comparing their computational costs, and investigating further strategies to increase both.},

listener differences on their emotion judgment. A total
of 80 musical excerpts were randomly selected from an
established dataset of 2,904 popular songs tagged with
one of the four words ‘‘happy,’’ ‘‘sad,’’ ‘‘angry,’’ or
‘‘relaxed’’ on the Last.FM web site. Participants listened
to the excerpts and rated perceived and induced emotion
on the categorical model and dimensional model, and
the reliability of emotion tags was evaluated according
to participants’ agreement with corresponding labels. In
addition, the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index
(Gold-MSI) was used to assess participants’ musical
expertise and engagement. As expected, regardless of
the emotion model used, music evokes emotions similar
to the emotional quality perceived in music. Moreover,
emotion tags predict music emotion judgments. How-
ever, age, gender and three factors from Gold-MSI,
importance, emotion, and music training were found not
to predict listeners’ responses, nor the agreement with
tags.},

  abstract = {Loudness variation is one of the foremost tools for expressivity in music performance. Loudness is frequently notated as dynamic markings such as "p" (piano, meaning soft) or "f" (forte, meaning loud). While dynamic markings in music scores are important indicators of how music pieces should be interpreted, their meaning is less straightforward than it may seem, and depends highly on the context in which they appear. In this article, we investigate the relationship between dynamic markings in the score and performed loudness by applying machine learning techniques – decision trees, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and a k-nearest neighbor method – to the prediction of loudness levels corresponding to dynamic markings, and to the classification of dynamic markings given loudness values. The methods are applied to 44 recordings of performances of Chopin's Mazurkas, each by 8 pianists. The results show that loudness values and markings can be predicted relatively well when trained across recordings of the same piece, but fail dismally when trained across the pianist's recordings of other pieces, demonstrating that score features may trump individual style when modeling loudness choices. Evidence suggests that all the features chosen for the task are relevant, and analysis of the results reveals the forms (such as the return of the theme) and structures (such as dynamic-marking repetitions) that influence the predictability of loudness and markings. Modeling of loudness trends in expressive performance appears to be a delicate matter, and sometimes loudness expression can be a matter of the performer's idiosyncracy.},

To demonstrate its potential, this model is employed to evaluate the performance of nine state of the art sound event detection systems submitted to the IEEE DCASE 2013 Challenge.

An initial frame-level estimation provides the necessary information for segmenting each pitch band in single instances which are later classified as active or non-active note events. Preliminary results using classic classification strategies on a subset of the MAPS piano dataset report an improvement of up to a 15\% when compared to the baseline considered for both frame-level and note-level assessment.},

This rich dataset includes audio recordings, scores transcribed by ethnomusicologists and aligned to the audio performances, and meter annotations. A second contribution of this paper is the creation of an automatic music transcription system able to support the detection of multiple pitches produced by lyra (a bowed string instrument). Furthermore, the transcription system is able to cope with deviations from standard tuning, and provides temporally quantized notes by combining the output of the multi-pitch detection stage with a state-of-the-art meter tracking algorithm. Experiments carried out for note tracking using 25ms onset tolerance reach 41.1\% using information from the multi-pitch detection stage only, 54.6\% when integrating beat information, and 57.9\% when also supporting tuning estimation. The produced meter aligned transcriptions can be used to generate staff notation, a fact that increases the value of the system for studies in ethnomusicology.},

The temporal succession of the templates is controlled through event class-wise Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). As input time/frequency representation, the Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) spectrogram is used. Experiments are carried out on polyphonic datasets of office sounds generated using an acoustic scene simulator, as well as real and synthesized monophonic datasets for comparative purposes. Results show that the proposed system outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for overlapping acoustic event detection on the same task, using both frame-based and event-based metrics, and is robust to varying event density and noise levels.},
