In this paper we advocate the need for a shift of attention towards emotional communication between people. To contextualise our views we discuss the ways in which rapid technological advances have impacted society and human psychology over the last decade. By outlining our doctoral research topic, we then highlight how affective computing based research could help us understand and enhance copresent human-human interactions. We are especially interested in studying situations where the interaction is directed towards collaborative creativity, as there is little existing work in this area and we see great potential for real-world applications to stem from our research.",

Clap your hands and the echoes will typically tell you if you are in a small office, a medium-sized classroom, or a large concert hall. However, is it possible to tell the shape of a room using sound alone? This is the question addressed by Dokmanić et al. (1) in PNAS",

However, birdsong often contains rapid pitch modulations, and these modulations carry information which may be of use in automatic recognition. In this paper we demonstrate that an improved spectrogram representation, based on the distribution derivative method, leads to improved performance of a segregation algorithm which uses a Markov renewal process model to track vocalisation patterns consisting of singing and silences. }

        abstract={We describe an inference task in which a set of timestamped event observations must be clustered into an unknown number of temporal sequences with independent and varying rates of observations. Various existing approaches to multi-object tracking assume a fixed number of sources and/or a fixed observation rate; we develop an approach to inferring structure in timestamped data produced by a mixture of an unknown and varying number of similar Markov renewal processes, plus independent clutter noise. The inference simultaneously distinguishes signal from noise as well as clustering signal observations into separate source streams. We illustrate the technique via synthetic experiments as well as an experiment to track a mixture of singing birds. Source code is available.
