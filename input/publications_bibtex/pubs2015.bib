  Abstract                 = { This paper presents a Bayesian probabilistic framework for real-time alignment of a recording or score with a live performance using an event-based approach. Multitrack audio files are processed using existing onset detection and harmonic analysis algorithms to create a representation of a musical performance as a sequence of time-stamped events. We propose the use of distributions for the position and relative speed which are sequentially updated in real-time according to Bayes’ theorem. We develop the methodology for this approach by describing its application in the case of matching a single MIDI track and then extend this to the case of multitrack recordings. An evaluation is presented that contrasts ourmultitrack alignment method with state-of-the-art alignment techniques. },

  Abstract                 = {Many current paradigms for acoustic event detection (AED) are not adapted to the organic variability of natural sounds, and/or they assume a limit on the number of simultaneous sources: often only one source, or one source of each type, may be active. These aspects are highly undesirable for applications such as bird population monitoring. We introduce a simple method modelling the onsets, durations and offsets of acoustic events to avoid intrinsic limits on polyphony or on inter-event temporal patterns. We evaluate the method in a case study with over 3000 zebra finch calls. In comparison against a HMM-based method we find it more accurate at recovering acoustic events, and more robust for estimating calling rates. },

  Abstract                 = {For intelligent systems to make best use of the audio modality, it is important that they can recognise not just speech and music, which have been researched as specific tasks, but also general sounds in everyday environments. To stimulate research in this field we conducted a public research challenge: the IEEE Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing Technical Committee challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE). In this paper we report on the state of the art in automatically classifying audio scenes, and automatically detecting and classifying audio events. We survey prior work as well as the state of the art represented by the submissions to the challenge from various research groups. We also provide detail on the organisation of the challenge, so that our experience as challenge hosts may be useful to those organising challenges in similar domains. We created new audio datasets and baseline systems for the challenge: these, as well as some submitted systems, are publicly available under open licenses, to serve as benchmark for further research in general-purpose machine listening.},

  Abstract                 = {The ``winning'' system in the 2013 MIREX Latin Genre Classification Task was a deep neural network trained with simple features. An explanation for its winning performance has yet to be found. In previous work, we built similar systems using the \em BALLROOM music dataset, and found their performances to be greatly affected by slightly changing the tempo of the music of a test recording. In the MIREX task, however, systems are trained and tested using the \em Latin Music Dataset (LMD), which is 4.5 times larger than \em BALLROOM, and which does not seem to show as strong a relationship between tempo and label as \em BALLROOM. In this paper, we reproduce the ``winning'' deep learning system using \em LMD, and measure the effects of time dilation on its performance. We find that tempo changes of at most \$\pm 6\$\\% greatly diminish and improve its performance. Interpreted with the low-level nature of the input features, this supports the conclusion that the system is exploiting some low-level absolute time characteristics to reproduce ground truth in \em LMD.},

An adversary is an algorithm that makes minor perturbations to an input that cause major repercussions to the system response. In particular, we design an adversary for a DNN that takes as input short-time spectral magnitudes of recorded music and outputs a high-level music descriptor. We demonstrate how this adversary can make the DNN behave in any way with only extremely minor changes to the music recording signal. We show that the adversary cannot be neutralised by a simple filtering of the input. Finally, we discuss adversaries in the broader context of the evaluation of music content analysis systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The current study expands our previous work on interlanguage musical timbre semantics by examining the relationship between semantics and perception of timbre. Following Zacharakis, Pastiadis, and Reiss (2014), a pairwise dissimilarity listening test involving participants from two separate linguistic groups (Greek and English) was conducted. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced a 3D perceptual timbre space for each language. The comparison between perceptual spaces suggested that timbre perception is unaffected by native language. Additionally, comparisons between semantic and perceptual spaces revealed substantial similarities which suggest that verbal descriptions can convey a considerable amount of perceptual information. The previously determined semantic labels "auditory texture" and "luminance" featured the highest associations with perceptual dimensions for both languages. "Auditory mass" failed to show any strong correlations. Acoustic analysis identified energy distribution of harmonic partials, spectral detail, temporal/spectrotemporal characteristics and the fundamental frequency as the most salient acoustic correlates of perceptual dimensions.},

Assuming a sufficient number of sound sources, we estimate the distance between a pair of devices from the extreme (minimum and maximum) time difference of arrivals (TDOAs) from the sources to the pair of devices without knowing the time offset. The obtained inter-device distances are then exploited to derive the geometrical configuration of the network. In particular, we propose a robust audio fingerprinting algorithm for noisy recordings and perform landmark matching to construct a histogram of the TDOAs of multiple sources. The extreme TDOAs can be estimated from this histogram. By using audio fingerprinting features, the proposed algorithm works robustly in very noisy environments. Experiments with free-field simulation and open-space recordings prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Audio quality is very important to broadcasters' audiences, and unwanted loudness variations do compromise the quality of experience for the listener. Dynamic range control applied by the broadcaster can go some way to avoiding problems but can never take the individual environment of the listener into account. The listening conditions are a significant factor to be taken into account when dynamic range control is applied. The web audio API provided by HTML5 offers the possibility of performing dynamic range control under the control of the listener, tailoring it optimally for their individual situation. We have developed a system that demonstrates that this is achievable in a modern web browser. The implementation controls the compressor based on environmental noise level measured using the microphone present in most mobile device audio players.},

Parameter automations incorporate control assumptions based on this experiment and those derived from mixing literature and analysis. Subjective evaluation of the intelligent system is provided in the form of a multiple stimulus listening test where the system is compared against a no-compression mix, two human mixes, and an alternative approach. Results showed that mixes devised by our system are able to compete with or outperform manual mixes by semi-professionals under a variety of subjective criteria.},

Accuracy varied according to label and emotion: while smilies are used more often, emoticons are more reliable. Happiness is the most accurately predicted emotion, with accuracies around 90\% on both distant and gold-standard labels. This approach works well and achieves high accuracies for happiness and anger, while it is less effective for sadness, surprise, disgust and fear, which are also difficult for human annotators to detect.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper seeks to situate the computational modelling of metaphor within the context of questions about the relationship between the meaning and use of language. The results of this pragmatic assessment are used as the theoretical basis for a proposed computational implementation that seeks metaphor in the geometry of a vector space model of distributional semantics. This statistical approach to the analysis and generation of metaphor is taken as a platform for a consideration of the fraught relationship between computational models of cognitive processes and the study of consciousness.},

  Abstract                 = {Performing musicians invest thousands of hours becoming experts in a range of perceptual, attentional, and cognitive skills. The duration and intensity of musicians' training - far greater than that of most educational or rehabilitation programs - provides a useful model to test the extent to which skills acquired in one particular context (music) generalize to different domains. Here, we asked whether the instrument-specific and more instrument-general skills acquired during professional violinists' and pianists' training would generalize to superior performance on a wide range of analogous (largely non-musical) skills, when compared to closely matched non-musicians. Violinists and pianists outperformed non-musicians on fine-grained auditory psychophysical measures, but surprisingly did not differ from each other, despite the different demands of their instruments. Musician groups did differ on a tuning system perception task: violinists showed clearest biases towards the tuning system specific to their instrument, suggesting that long-term experience leads to selective perceptual benefits given a training-relevant context. However, we found only weak evidence of group differences in non-musical skills, with musicians differing marginally in one measure of sustained auditory attention, but not significantly on auditory scene analysis or multi-modal sequencing measures. Further, regression analyses showed that this sustained auditory attention metric predicted more variance in one auditory psychophysical measure than did musical expertise. Our findings suggest that specific musical expertise may yield distinct perceptual outcomes within contexts close to the area of training. Generalization of expertise to relevant cognitive domains may be less clear, particularly where the task context is non-musical.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of score-performance synchronisation is to align a given musical score to an audio recording of a performance of the same piece. A major challenge in computing such alignments is to account for musical parameters including the local tempo or playing style. To increase the overall robustness, current methods assume that notes occurring simultaneously in the score are played concurrently in a performance. Musical voices such as the melody, however, are often played asynchronously to other voices, which can lead to significant local alignment errors. In this paper, we present a novel method that handles asynchronies between the melody and the accompaniment by treating the voices as separate timelines in a multi-dimensional variant of dynamic time warping (DTW). Constraining the alignment with information obtained via classical DTW, our method measurably improves the alignment accuracy for pieces with asynchronous voices and preserves the accuracy otherwise.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates methods for quantifying similarity between audio signals, specifically for the task of cover song detection. We consider an information-theoretic approach, where we compute pairwise measures of predictability between time series. We compare discrete-valued approaches operating on quantized audio features, to continuous-valued approaches. In the discrete case, we propose a method for computing the normalized compression distance, where we account for correlation between time series. In the continuous case, we propose to compute information-based measures of similarity as statistics of the prediction error between time series. We evaluate our methods on two cover song identification tasks using a data set comprised of 300 Jazz standards and using the Million Song Dataset. For both datasets, we observe that continuous-valued approaches outperform discrete-valued approaches. We consider approaches to estimating the normalized compression distance (NCD) based on string compression and prediction, where we observe that our proposed normalized compression distance with alignment (NCDA) improves average performance over NCD, for sequential compression algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that continuous-valued distances may be combined to improve performance with respect to baseline approaches. Using a large-scale filter-and-refine approach, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for cover song identification using the Million Song Dataset.},

A small light display then provides visual feedback to each musician, based either on the gaze or the body motion of their co-performer. We carried out an experiment with 15 pairs of music students in order to investigate how the LuminUs would influence their musical interactions. Preliminary results suggest that visual feedback provided by the LuminUs led to significantly increased glancing between the two musicians, whilst motion based feedback appeared to lead to a decrease in body motion for both participants.},

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom. Our results indicate that ECG, motion, and glance measurements could be particularly suitable for the investigation of collaborative music making.},

A study of the use of the technology is reported which found that high arousal and high valence were reliably conveyed through haptic patterns with high intensity and high frequency, whereas haptic patterns with low intensity and low frequency conveyed low arousal and low valence.},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic music transcription, a central topic in music signal analysis, is typically limited to equal-tempered music and evaluated on a quartertone tolerance level. A system is proposed to automatically transcribe microtonal and heterophonic music as applied to the makam music of Turkey. Specific traits of this music that deviate from properties targeted by current transcription tools are discussed, and a collection of instrumental and vocal recordings is compiled, along with aligned microtonal reference pitch annotations. An existing multi-pitch detection algorithm is adapted for transcribing music with 20 cent resolution, and a method for converting a multi-pitch heterophonic output into a single melodic line is proposed. Evaluation metrics for transcribing microtonal music are applied, which use various levels of tolerance for inaccuracies with respect to frequency and time. Results show that the system is able to transcribe microtonal instrumental music at 20 cent resolution with an F-measure of 56.7\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for the same task. Case studies on transcribed recordings are provided, to demonstrate the shortcomings and the strengths of the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {For intelligent systems to make best use of the audio modality, it is important that they can recognize not just speech and music, which have been researched as specific tasks, but also general sounds in everyday environments. To stimulate research in this field we conducted a public research challenge: the IEEE Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing Technical Committee challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE). In this paper, we report on the state of the art in automatically classifying audio scenes, and automatically detecting and classifying audio events. We survey prior work as well as the state of the art represented by the submissions to the challenge from various research groups. We also provide detail on the organization of the challenge, so that our experience as challenge hosts may be useful to those organizing challenges in similar domains. We created new audio datasets and baseline systems for the challenge; these, as well as some submitted systems, are publicly available under open licenses, to serve as benchmarks for further research in general-purpose machine listening.},
