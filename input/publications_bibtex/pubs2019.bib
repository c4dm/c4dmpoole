abstract = {© The Author(s) 2018. In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.},

year = {2019},
abstract = {© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM. In this paper, we address how to evaluate and improve the performance of automatic dominant melody extraction systems from a pattern mining perspective with a focus on jazz improvisations. Traditionally, dominant melody extraction systems estimate the melody on the frame-level, but for real-world musicological applications note-level representations are needed. For the evaluation of estimated note tracks, the current frame-wise metrics are not fully suitable and provide at most a first approximation. Furthermore, miningmelodic patterns (n-grams) poses another challenge because note-wise errors propagate geometrically with increasing length of the pattern. On the other hand, for certain derived metrics such as pattern commonalities between performers, extraction errors might be less critical if at least qualitative rankings can be reproduced. Finally, while searching for similar patterns in a melody database the number of irrelevant patterns in the result set increases with lower similarity thresholds. For reasons of usability, it would be interesting to know the behavior using imperfect automated melody extractions. We propose three novel evaluation strategies for estimated note-tracks based on three application scenarios: Pattern mining, pattern commonalities, and fuzzy pattern search. We apply the proposed metrics to one general state-of-the-art melody estimation method (Melodia) and to two variants of an algorithm that was optimized for the extraction of jazz solos melodies. A subset of the Weimar Jazz Database with 91 solos was used for evaluation. Results show that the optimized algorithm clearly outperforms the reference algorithm, which quickly degrades and eventually breaks down for longer n-grams. Frame-wise metrics provide indeed an estimate for note-wise metrics, but only for sufficiently good extractions, whereas F1 scores for longer n-grams cannot be predicted from frame-wise F1 scores at all. The ranking of pattern commonalities between performers can be reproduced with the optimized algorithms but not with the reference algorithm. Finally, the size of result sets of pattern similarity searches decreases for automated note extraction and for larger similarity thresholds but the difference levels out for smaller thresholds.},

The authors recorded five soprano, alto, tenor, bass quartets singing two pieces of music in three different listening conditions, according to whether the singers can hear the other participants or not. After analysing all of the individual notes and extracting pitch over time, the authors observed the following regularities: (1) There are transient parts of approximately 120 ms duration at both the beginning and end of a note, where the pitch varies rapidly; (2) the shapes of transient parts differ significantly according to the adjacent pitch, although all singers tend to have a descending transient at the end of a note; (3) the trajectory shapes of female singers differ from those of male singers at the beginnings of notes; (4) between vocal parts, there is a tendency to expand harmonic intervals (by about 8 cents between adjacent voices); (5) the listening condition had no significant effect on within-note pitch trajectories.},

abstract = {© 2018 APSIPA organization. Statistical models of musical scores play an important role in various tasks of music information processing. It has been an open problem to construct a score model incorporating global repetitive structure of note sequences, which is expected to be useful for music transcription and other tasks. Since repetitions can be described by a sparse distribution over note patterns (segments of music), a possible solution is to consider a Bayesian score model in which such a sparse distribution is first generated for each individual piece and then musical notes are generated in units of note patterns according to the distribution. However, straightforward construction is impractical due to the enormous number of possible note patterns. We propose a probabilistic model that represents a cluster of note patterns, instead of explicitly dealing with the set of all possible note patterns, to attain computational tractability. A score model is constructed as a mixture or a Markov model of such clusters, which is compatible with the above framework for describing repetitive structure. As a practical test to evaluate the potential of the model, we consider the problem of singing transcription from vocal f0 trajectories. Evaluation results show that our model achieves better predictive ability and transcription accuracies compared to the conventional Markov model, nearly reaching state-of-the-art performance.},

Eight pairs of singers sang two excerpts either in unison or two-part harmony. The experimental condition varied which singers could hear singing partners. After semi-automatic pitch-tracking and manual checking, this paper calculated the pitch error (PE) and interval error and tested the factors of influence using a one-way analysis of variance and a linear mixed-effects model. The results indicate that: (1) singing with the same vocal part is more accurate than singing with a different vocal part; (2) singing solo has less pPE than singing with a partner; (3) PEs are correlated, as singers adjust pitch to mitigate a partner's error and preserve harmonic intervals at the expense of melodic intervals and absolute pitch; (4) other factors influence the pitch accuracy, including: score pitch, score harmonic interval, score melodic interval, musical background, vocal part, and individual differences.},

We model expressive timing for a phrase in performed classical music as being dependent on two factors: the expressive timing in the previous phrase and the position of the phrase within the piece. We present a model selection test for evaluating candidate models that assert different dependencies for deciding the Cluster of Expressive Timing (CET) for a phrase. We use cross entropy and Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence to evaluate the resulting models: with these criteria we find that both the expressive timing in the previous phrase and the position of the phrase in the music score affect expressive timing in a phrase. The results show that the expressive timing in the previous phrase has a greater effect on timing choices than the position of the phrase, as the phrase position only impacts the choice of expressive timing in combination with the choice of expressive timing in the previous phrase.},

The publisher has no means to incorporate their intentions or understanding of the content.

It discusses how various kinds of multi-hierarchical graph structures together with logical constraints can be useful to model different musical situations. In particular, we focus on presenting solutions on how to interpret, navigate and schedule such structures in order for them to be played back. We evaluate the versatility of the representation in a number of practical examples created with a Web-based implementation based on Semantic Web technologies.},

abstract = {Music production technology has made few advancements over the past few decades. State-of-the-art approaches are based on traditional studio paradigms with new developments primarily focusing on digital modelling of analog equipment. Intelligent music production (IMP) is the approach of introducing some level of artificial intelligence into the space of music production, which has the ability to change the field considerably. There are a multitude of methods that intelligent systems can employ to analyse, interact with, and modify audio. Some systems interact and collaborate with human mix engineers, while others are purely black box autonomous systems, which are uninterpretable and challenging to work with. This article outlines a number of key decisions that need to be considered while producing an intelligent music production system, and identifies some of the assumptions and constraints of each of the various approaches. One of the key aspects to consider in any IMP system is how an individual will interact with the system, and to what extent they can consistently use any IMP tools. The other key aspects are how the target or goal of the system is created and defined, and the manner in which the system directly interacts with audio. The potential for IMP systems to produce new and interesting approaches for analysing and manipulating audio, both for the intended application and creative misappropriation, is considerable.},

The contribution of this study is two-fold. Firstly, a new Amateur Vocal Percussion (AVP) dataset is introduced to investigate how people with little or no experience in beatboxing approach the task of vocal percussion. The end-goal of this analysis is that of helping mapping algorithms to better generalise between subjects and achieve higher performances. The dataset comprises a total of 9780 utterances recorded by 28 participants with fully annotated onsets and labels (kick drum, snare drum, closed hi-hat and opened hi-hat). Lastly, we conducted baseline experiments on audio onset detection with the recorded dataset, comparing the performance of four state-of-the-art algorithms in a vocal percussion context.},

However, there has been little research on vocal imitation of percussion sounds, particularly concerning the perceptual similarity between imitations and the sounds being imitated. In the present study we address this by investigating how accurately musicians can vocally imitate percussion sounds, in terms of whether listeners consider the imitations 'more similar' to the imitated sounds than to other same-category sounds. In a vocal production task, 14 musicians imitated 30 drum sounds from five categories (cymbals, hats, kicks, snares, toms). Listeners were then asked to rate the similarity between the imitations and same-category drum sounds via web based listening test. We found that imitated sounds received the highest similarity ratings for 16 of the 30 sounds. The similarity between a given drum sound and its imitation was generally rated higher than for imitations of another same-category sound, however for some drum categories (snares and toms) certain sounds were consistently considered most similar to the imitations, irrespective of the sound being imitated. Finally, we apply an existing auditory image based measure for perceptual similarity between same-category drum sounds, to model the similarity ratings using linear mixed effect regression. The results indicate that this measure is a good predictor of perceptual similarity between imitations and imitated sounds, when compared to acoustic features containing only temporal or spectral features.},

Three degrees of freedom head-tracking is implemented within acceptable levels of latency and at 1º angular resolution. The technical performance of virtual VBAP is evaluated alongside a First Order Ambisonics (FOA) approach on the same platform, using analysis of localisation cue error against a human-measured head-related transfer function set. Our findings illustrate that, in scenarios utilising embedded or other portable, low-resource computing platforms, the nature and requirements of the immersive or interactive audio application at hand may determine whether virtual VBAP is a viable (or even preferable) approach compared to virtual FOA.},

abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. The FAST project (Fusing Audio and Semantic Technology for Intelligent Music Production and Consumption) with 5 years of UK funding, has sought to create a new musical ecosystem that empowers all manner of people, from professional performers to casual listeners, to engage in new, more creative, immersive and dynamic musical experiences. Realising this requires a step-change in digital music technologies. Going beyond today's digital sound files, future experiences will demand far richer musical information, whereby music content will be packaged in a flexible, structured way that combines audio recordings with rich, layered metadata to support interactive and adaptive musical experiences. This defines the overall ambition of FAST-to lay the foundations for a new generation of 'semantic audio' technologies that underpin diverse future music experiences. This paper therefore aims to describe the overall vision of the project, set out the broad landscape in which it is working, highlight some key results and show how they bring out a central notion of FAST, that of Digital Music Objects, which are flexible constructs consisting of recorded music essence coupled with rich, semantic, linked metadata.},

abstract = {© 147th Audio Engineering Society International Convention 2019. All rights reserved. There is a body of work in the field of intelligent music production, covering a range of specific audio effects. However, there is a distinct lack of any purely machine learning approaches to automatic mixing. This could be due to a lack of suitable data. This paper presents an approach to used human produced audio mixes, along with their source multitrack, to produce the set of mix parameters. The focus will be entirely on the gain mixing of audio drum tracks. Using existing reverse engineering of music production gain parameters, a target mix gain parameter is identified, and these results are fed into a number of machine learning algorithms, along with audio feature vectors of each audio track. This allow for a machine learning prediction approach to audio gain mixing. A random forest approach is taken to perform a multiple output prediction. The prediction results of the random forest approach are then compared to a number of other published automatic gain mixing approaches. The results demonstrate that the random forest gain mixing approach performs similarly to that of a human engineer and outperforms the existing gain mixing approaches.},

abstract = {© 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Augmented visual-audio feedback supports rhythmic motor performance in both sports training and sensorimotor synchronization practise. In home-based rehabilitation for minor stroke patients, training on a fine motor skill using rhythms not only helps to recover sophisticated motion ability but also increases their confidence and mental health recovery. Auditory information has been shown to have advantages for improving rhythmic motion performance, but it can be masked by environmental noise and may be intrusive to non-stakeholders. Under these circumstances, patients may be reluctant to practice actively due to difficulties hearing the auditory stimuli or through a concern for disturbing others. To address this issue, we explored an inconspicuous way of providing vibrotactile feedback through wristband. In order to investigate the general feasibility of a sensorimotor synchronization task, we conducted a preliminary user study with 16 healthy participants, and compared the visual-tactile feedback with visual-audio, visual-audio-tactile and visual-only feedback. Results showed that rhythmic motion accuracy with visual-tactile feedback has the equivalent facilitatory effect with visual-audio feedback. In addition, visual-tactile feedback supports smoother movements than the visual-audio feedback. In the future, after refinement with stroke patients, the system could support customization for different levels of sensorimotor synchronization training.},

abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. Gaussian process (GP) audio source separation is a time- domain approach that circumvents the inherent phase approx- imation issue of spectrogram based methods. Furthermore, through its kernel, GPs elegantly incorporate prior knowl- edge about the sources into the separation model. Despite these compelling advantages, the computational complexity of GP inference scales cubically with the number of audio samples. As a result, source separation GP models have been restricted to the analysis of short audio frames. We intro- duce an efficient application of GPs to time-domain audio source separation, without compromising performance. For this purpose, we used GP regression, together with spectral mixture kernels, and variational sparse GPs. We compared our method with LD-PSDTF (positive semi-definite tensor factorization), KL-NMF (Kullback-Leibler non-negative ma- trix factorization), and IS-NMF (Itakura-Saito NMF). Results show that the proposed method outperforms these techniques.},

Various methods have been studied to combat the effects of reverberation in speech and audio signals, but it is not clear how well they generalise to other sound types. We look at extending these models to facilitate machine-to-machine acoustic signalling. This research investigates dereverberation techniques to shortlist a single-channel reverberation suppression method through a pilot test. In order to apply the chosen dereverberation method a novel method of estimating acoustic parameters governing reverberation is proposed. The performance of the final algorithm is evaluated on quality metrics as well as the performance of a real machine-to-machine decoder.

In this paper, we carry out a perceptual study to evaluate the performance of a number of state-of-the-art models for estimating similarity of drum patterns. 24 listeners rated similarity between 80 pairs of drum patterns covering a range of styles. We find that many of the models perform well, especially those using density-based features, and a more simplistic rhythm-pattern distance. However, many of the most perceptually important factors reported by listeners (such as swing, genre and style, instrument distribution) are not adequately accounted for. We also introduce a velocity transform method to better incorporate variable onset intensity into rhythm similarity analysis. Inter-rater agreement analysis shows that models are also limited somewhat by individual perceptual differences. These findings will inform future research into improved approaches to drum pattern similarity modelling that integrate existing features with new features modelling a wider range of characteristics.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous music (UbiMus) proposes to study how social interaction with mobile and distributed technologies can converge to form novel creativity support tools and music artistic practices.

Musical Things embed electronics, sensors, data forwarding and processing software into physical or virtual objects. Smart musical instruments (SMIs) are an emerging class of Musical Things provided with capabilities of capturing and receiving data supporting instrumental musical practice. Due to their portability and self-containdeness, SMIs enable novel ubiquitous interactions between performers of acoustic and digital musical instruments. After a review of current trends in SMI research, we propose an ubiquitous smart guitar system which uses the guitar as a hub for collaborative music making. We then present a survey conducted with 18 performers to assess the usability, creativity support and engagement with the system. Results show a positive emotional engagement with the system which overall was found easy to use and novel.

Intelligent interfaces are therefore useful in enabling navigation of these databases in a way that supports the production workflow. Within virtual drumming software, producers typically rely on large libraries of symbolic drum loops. Due to their large size, navigating and exploring these libraries can be a difficult process. To address this, preliminary work is presented into the Groove Explorer. Using Self-Organizing Maps, a large library of symbolic drum loops is automatically mapped on a 2D space according to rhythmic similarity. This space can then be explored via a Max/MSP prototype interface. Early results suggest that while the algorithm works well for smaller datasets, further development is required, particularly in the similarity metric used, to make the tool scalable to large libraries.},

abstract = {© 147th Audio Engineering Society International Convention 2019. All rights reserved. The impact of reverberation on musical expressivity is an area of growing interest as technology to simulate, and create, acoustic environments improves. Being able to characterise the impact of acoustic environments on musical performance is a problem of interest to acousticians, designers of virtual environments, and algorithmic composers. We analyse the impact of convolution reverberation time on note duration and note velocity, which serve as markers of musical expressivity. To improve note clarity in situations of long reverberation times, we posit musicians performing in a duo would lengthen the separation between notes (note duration) and increase loudness (note velocity) contrast. The data for this study comprises of MIDI messages extracted from performances by 2 co-located pianists playing the same piece of music 100 times across 5 different reverberation conditions. To our knowledge, this is the largest data set to date looking at piano duo performance in a range of reverberation conditions. In contrast to prior work the analysis considers both the entire performance as well as an excerpt at the opening part of the piece featuring a key structural element of the score. This analysis finds convolution reverberation time is found to be moderately positively correlated with mean note duration (r = 0.34 and p =< 0.001), but no significant correlation was found between convolution reverberation time and mean note velocity (r = −0.19 and p = 0.058).},

We use scheduled sampling to make the MLM robust to noisy sequences during testing. We analyze the performance of our model on the MAPS dataset using two different timesteps (40ms and 16th-note), comparing it against a strong baseline hidden Markov model with a training method not used before for the task to our knowledge. We report a statistically significant improvement over HMM decoding in terms of notewise F-measure with both timesteps, with 16th note timesteps improving further compared to 40ms timesteps.},

We collect and analyze quantitative measures such as transcription time and effort, and a range of qualitative feedback from study participants, which includes user needs, criticisms of AMT technologies, and links between perceptual and quantitative evaluations on AMT outputs. The results show no quantitative advantage of using AMT, but important indications regarding appropriate user groups and evaluation measures are provided.},

abstract = {Vibratos, tremolos, trills, and flutter-tongue are techniques frequently found in vocal and instrumental music. A common feature of these techniques is the periodic modulation in the time--frequency domain. We propose a representation based on time--frequency scattering to model the inter-class variability for fine discrimination of these periodic modulations. Time--frequency scattering is an instance of the scattering transform, an approach for building invariant, stable, and informative signal representations. The proposed representation is calculated around the wavelet subband of maximal acoustic energy, rather than over all the wavelet bands. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we build a system that computes the representation as input to a machine learning classifier. Whereas previously published datasets for playing technique analysis focus primarily on techniques recorded in isolation, for ecological validity, we create a new dataset to evaluate the system. The dataset, named CBF-periDB, contains full-length expert performances on the Chinese bamboo flute that have been thoroughly annotated by the players themselves. We report F-measures of 99\% for flutter-tongue, 82\% for trill, 69\% for vibrato, and 51\% for tremolo detection, and provide explanatory visualisations of scattering coefficients for each of these techniques.},

abstract = {Automatic transcription of polyphonic music remains a challenging task in the field of Music Information Retrieval. One under-investigated point is the post-processing of time-pitch posteriograms into binary piano rolls.
In this study, we investigate this task using a variety of neural network models and training procedures. We introduce an adversarial framework, that we compare against more traditional training losses. We also propose the use of binary neuron outputs and compare them to the usual real-valued outputs in both training frameworks. This allows us to train networks directly using the F-measure as training objective. We evaluate these methods using two kinds of transduction networks and two different multi-pitch detection systems, and compare the results against baseline note-tracking methods on a dataset of classical piano music. Analysis of results indicates that (1) convolutional models improve results over baseline models, but no improvement is reported for recurrent models; (2) supervised losses are superior to adversarial ones; (3) binary neurons do not improve results; (4) cross-entropy loss results in better or equal performance compared to the F-measure loss.},

By performing this analysis, we aim to provide insights on strengths and weaknesses in current adversarial attack algorithms as well as provide a baseline for defenses against adversarial attacks. Our work shows that adversarial attacks are not robust to simple input transformations. White noise is the most consistent method to defend against adversarial attacks with a success rate of 73.72\% averaged across all models and attack algorithms.},

abstract = {State of the art polyphonic sound event detection (SED) systems function as frame-level multi-label classification models. In the context of dynamic polyphony levels at each frame, sound events interfere with each other which degrade a classifier's ability to learn the exact frequency profile of individual sound events. Frame-level localized classifiers also fail to explicitly model the long-term temporal structure of sound events. Consequently, the event-wise detection performance is less than the segment-wise detection. We define 'temporally precise polyphonic sound event detection' as the subtask of detecting sound event instances with the correct onset. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of sound activity detection (SAD) and onset detection as auxiliary tasks to improve temporal precision in polyphonic SED using multi-task learning. SAD helps to differentiate event activity frames from noisy and silence frames and helps to avoid missed detections at each frame. Onset predictions ensure the start of each event which in turn are used to condition predictions of both SAD and SED. Our experiments on the URBAN-SED dataset show that by conditioning SED with onset detection and SAD, there is over a three-fold relative improvement in event-based F-score.},

The dataset contains ~42.5 hours of audio recordings divided across 20 classes, with a small amount of manually verified labels and a large amount of noisy data. Using this dataset, our work intends to explore the potential of modelling the label noise distribution by adding a linear layer on top of a baseline network. The accuracy of the approach is compared to an alternative approach of adopting a noise robust loss function. Results show that modelling the noise distribution improves the accuracy of the baseline network in a similar capacity to the soft bootstrapping loss.},

abstract = {Polyphonic Sound Event Detection (SED) in real-world recordings is a challenging task because of the dynamic polyphony level, intensity, and duration of sound events. Current polyphonic SED systems fail to model the temporal structure of sound events explicitly and instead attempt to look at which sound events are present at each audio frame. Consequently, the event-wise detection performance is much lower than the segment-wise detection performance. In this work, we propose a joint model approach to improve the temporal localization of sound events using a multi-task learning setup. The first task predicts which sound events are present at each time frame; we call this branch 'Sound Event Detection (SED) model', while the second task predicts if a sound event is present or not at each frame; we call this branch 'Sound Activity Detection (SAD) model'. We verify the proposed joint model by comparing it with a separate implementation of both tasks aggregated together from individual task predictions. Our experiments on the URBAN-SED dataset show that the proposed joint model can alleviate False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) errors and improve both the segment-wise and the event-wise metrics.},

year = {2019},
abstract = {The majority of sound scene analysis work focuses on one of two clearly defined tasks: acoustic scene classification or sound event detection. Whilst this separation of tasks is useful for problem definition, they inherently ignore some subtleties of the real-world, in particular how humans vary in how they describe a scene. Some will describe the weather and features within it, others will use a holistic descriptor like 'park', and others still will use unique identifiers such as cities or names. In this paper, we undertake the task of automatic city classification to ask whether we can recognize a city from a set of sound scenes? In this problem each city has recordings from multiple scenes. We test a series of methods for this novel task and show that a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) can achieve accuracy of 50\%. This is less than the acoustic scene classification task baseline in the DCASE 2018 ASC challenge on the same data. A simple adaptation to the class labels of pairing city labels with grouped scenes, accuracy increases to 52\%, closer to the simpler scene classification task. Finally we also formulate the problem in a multi-task learning framework and achieve an accuracy of 56\%, outperforming the aforementioned approaches.},

We propose dataset partitions that ensure different attack types are present during training and validation to improve system robustness. Our ensemble model outperforms all our single models and the baselines from the challenge for both attack types. We investigate why some models on the PA dataset strongly outperform others and find that spoofed recordings in the dataset tend to have longer silences at the end than genuine ones. By removing them, the PA task becomes much more challenging, with the tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) of our best single model rising from 0.1672 to 0.5018 and equal error rate (EER) increasing from 5.98\% to 19.8\% on the development set.},

abstract = {Sound event detection in real-world environments suffers from the interference of non-stationary and time-varying noise. This paper presents an adaptive noise reduction method for sound event detection based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). First, a scheme for noise dictionary learning from the input noisy signal is employed by the technique of robust NMF, which supports adaptation to noise variations. The estimated noise dictionary is used to develop a supervised source separation framework in combination with a pre-trained event dictionary. Second, to improve the separation quality, we extend the basic NMF model to a weighted form, with the aim of varying the relative importance of the different components when separating a target sound event from noise. With properly designed weights, the separation process is forced to rely more on those dominant event components, whereas the noise gets greatly suppressed. The proposed method is evaluated on a dataset of the rare sound event detection task of the DCASE 2017 challenge, and achieves comparable results to the top-ranking system based on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). The proposed weighted NMF method shows an excellent noise reduction ability, and achieves an improvement of an F-score by 5\%, compared to the unweighted approach.},

year = {2019},
abstract = {Neural networks, and in general machine learning techniques, have been widely employed in forecasting time series and more recently in predicting spatial-temporal signals. All of these approaches involve some kind of feature selection regarding what past data and what neighbour data to use for forecasting. In this article, we show extensive empirical evidence on how to independently construct the optimal feature selection or input representation used by  the input layer of a feed forward neural network for the purpose of forecasting spatial-temporal signals. The approach is based on results from dynamical systems theory, namely non-linear embedding theorems. We demonstrate it for a variety of spatial-temporal signals, and show that the optimal input layer representation consists of a grid, with spatial/temporal lags determined by the minimum of the mutual information of the spatial/temporal signals and the number of points taken in space/time decided by the embedding dimension of the signal. We present evidence of this proposal by running a Monte Carlo simulation of several combinations of input layer feature designs and show that the one predicted by the non-linear embedding theorems seems to be optimal or close to being  optimal. In total we show evidence in four unrelated systems: a series of coupled Henon maps; a series of coupled ordinary differential Equations (Lorenz-96) phenomenologically modelling atmospheric dynamics; the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a partial differential equation used in studies of instabilities in laminar flame fronts and finally real physical  data from sunspot areas in the Sun (in latitude and time) from 1874 to 2015. These four examples cover the range from simple toy models  to complex non-linear dynamical simulations, and real data. Finally, we also compare our proposal against alternative feature selection methods, and show that it  also works for other machine learning forecasting models.},

abstract = {Playing techniques such as ornamentations and articulation effects constitute important aspects of music performance. However, their computational analysis is still at an early stage due to a lack of instrument diversity, established methodologies and informative data. Focusing on the Chinese bamboo flute, we introduce a two-stage glissando detection system based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) with Gaussian mixtures. A rule-based segmentation process extracts glissando candidates that are consecutive note changes in the same direction. Glissandi are then identified by two HMMs. The study uses a newly created dataset of Chinese bamboo flute recordings, including both isolated glissandi and real-world pieces. The results, based on both frame- and segment-based evaluation for ascending and descending glissandi respectively, confirm the feasibility of the proposed method for glissando detection. Better detection performance of ascending glissandi over descending ones is obtained due to their more regular patterns. Inaccurate pitch estimation forms a main obstacle for successful fully-automated glissando detection. The dataset and method can be used for performance analysis.},

Methods based on spectrogram factorisation may suffer from local-optima issues in the presence of harmonic overlap or considerable timbre variability. To alleviate this issue, we propose a set of harmonic constraints that are inherent to the Harmonica instrument note layout or are caused by specific diatonic Harmonica playing techniques. These constraints help to guide the factorisation process until  convergence into meaningful multi-pitch activations is achieved. This work also builds a new audio dataset containing solo recordings of diatonic Harmonica excerpts and the respective multi-pitch annotations. We compare our proposed approach against multiple baseline techniques for automatic music transcription on this dataset and report the results  based on frame-based F-measure statistics.},

However, this requires a careful selection of hyper-parameters to generate interpretable examples for each neuron of interest, and current methods rely on a manual, qualitative evaluation of each setting, which is prohibitively slow. We introduce a new metric that uses Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to encourage similarity between model activations for real and generated data. This provides an efficient way to evaluate a set of generated examples for each setting of hyper-parameters. We also propose a novel GAN-based method for generating explanations that enables an efficient search through the input space and imposes a strong prior favouring realistic outputs. We apply our approach to a classification model trained to predict whether a music audio recording contains singing voice. Our results suggest that this proposed metric successfully selects hyper-parameters leading to interpretable examples, avoiding the need for manual evaluation. Moreover, we see that examples synthesised to maximise or minimise the predicted probability of singing voice presence exhibit vocal or non-vocal characteristics, respectively, suggesting that our approach is able to generate suitable explanations for understanding concepts learned by a neural network.},

abstract = {Shared virtual environments (SVEs) have been researched extensively within the fields of education, entertainment, work, and training, yet there has been limited research on the creative and collaborative aspects of interactivity in SVEs. The important role that creativity and collaboration play in human society raises the question of the way that virtual working spaces might be designed to support collaborative creativity in SVEs. In this paper, we outline an SVE named LeMo, which allows two people to collaboratively create a short loop of music together. Then we present a study of LeMo, in which 52 users composed music in pairs using four different virtual working space configurations. Key findings indicated by results include: (i) Providing personal space is an effective way to support collaborative creativity in SVEs, (ii) personal spaces with a fluid light-weight boundary could provide enough support, worked better and was preferable to ones with rigid boundaries and (iii) a configuration that provides a movable personal space was preferred to one that provided no mobility. Following these findings, five corresponding design implications for shared virtual environments focusing on supporting collaborative creativity are given and conclusions are made.},

Knit e-textile sensors can be used to detect stretch or strain, and when integrated directly into wearable garments, they can be used to detect movement of the human body. However, before they can reliably be used in real-world applications, the garment construction technique and the effects of wear due to washing need to be considered. This paper presents a study examining how thermal bonding and washing affects piezo-resistive textile sensors. Three textile strain sensors are considered all using Technik-tex P130B as the conductive material: i) conductive fabric only, ii) conductive fabric bonded to on one side to Eurojersey fabric, and iii) conductive fabric with Eurojersey bonded on top and bottom of the conductive fabric. The sensors’ performance is evaluated using a tensile tester while monitoring their electrical resistance before and after washing. The findings show that a single layer of bonding is the ideal construction and that after three wash cycles the sensor remains reliable.},

Wearable technology is widely used for collecting information about the human body and its movement by placing sensors on the body. This paper presents research into electronic textile strain sensors designed specifically for wearable applications which need to be lightweight, robust, and comfortable. In this paper, sixteen stretch sensors, each with different conductive stretch fabrics, are evaluated: EeonTex (Eeonyx Corporation), knitted silver-plated yarn, and knitted spun stainless steel yarn. The sensors’ performance is tested using a tensile tester while monitoring their resistance with a microcontroller. Each sensor was analyzed for its sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, responsiveness, and fatigue through a series of dynamic and static tests. The findings show that for wearable applications a subset of the silver-plated yarn sensors had better ranked performance in terms of sensitivity, linearity, and steady state. EeonTex was found to be the most responsive, and the stainless steel yarn performed the worst, which may be due to the characteristics of the knit samples under test.},

We uncover the practical methods two experienced music producers use to coordinate their understanding of multi-modal and spatial representations of music as part of their workflow. We show embodied spatial referencing as a significant feature of the music producers' interactions. Our analysis suggests that gesture is used to understand, communicate and form action through a process of shaping sounds in space. This metaphor highlights how aesthetic assessments are collaboratively produced and developed through coordinated spatial activity. Our implications establish sensitivity to embodied action in the development of collaborative workspaces for creative, spatial-media production of music.},

Children with autism may find it difficult to socialize, particularly initiating and maintaining human interactions. Consecutively, it is thought that playing with peers is often a challenge that many children avoid by simply playing in solitary mode. We present the design of Mazi, an e-textile sonic tangible user interface (TUI) designed with the aim of promoting basic social skills; stimulating spontaneous, independent and collaborative play; and providing sensory regulation opportunities. Mazi was tested in a SEN School based in North-East London, with a group of five children with moderate to high support needs autism aged between 6 to 9. The results show great potentials for TUI implementation in educational settings as a way of promoting social skills through carefully designed playful and recreational activities.},

abstract = {© 2019 ACM. We present the Flow framework1, a front-end framework for interactive Web applications built on the Web Audio API. It encourages a purely declarative approach to application design by providing a number of abstractions for the creation of HTML, audio processing graphs, and event listeners. In doing so we place the burden of tracking and managing state solely on to the framework rather than the developer. We introduce the Model-View-Update architecture and how it applies to audio application design. The MVU architecture is built on the unidirectional flow of data through pure functions, pushing side effects onto the framework's runtime. Flow conceptualises the audio graph as another View into application state, and uses this conceptualisation to enforce strict separation of the audio and visual output of an application. Future plans for the framework include a robust plug-in system to add support for third-party audio nodes, a time travelling debugger to replay sequences of actions to the runtime, and a bespoke programming language that better aligns with Flow's functional influences.},

abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. Detecting piano pedalling techniques in polyphonic music remains a challenging task in music information retrieval. While other piano-related tasks, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, have seen improvement through applying deep learning methods, little work has been done to develop deep learning models to detect playing techniques. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for the detection of sustain-pedal techniques, which are commonly used by pianists to enrich the sound. In the source task, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for learning spectral and temporal contexts when the sustain pedal is pressed using a large dataset generated by a physical modelling virtual instrument. The CNN is designed and experimented through exploiting the knowledge of piano acoustics and physics. This can achieve an accuracy score of 0.98 in the validation results. In the target task, the knowledge learned from the synthesised data can be transferred to detect the sustain pedal in acoustic piano recordings. A concatenated feature vector using the activations of the trained convolutional layers is extracted from the recordings and classified into frame-wise pedal press or release. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in acoustic piano recordings of Chopin's music. From the cross-validation results, the proposed transfer learning method achieves an average F-measure of 0.89 and an overall performance of 0.84 obtained using the micro-averaged F-measure. These results outperform applying the pre-trained CNN model directly or the model with a fine-tuned last layer.},

This facilitates an intelligent control system that uses audio examples to configure the DRC, a widely used nonlinear audio signal conditioning technique in the areas of music production, speech communication and broadcasting. Several alternative siamese DNN architectures are proposed to learn feature embeddings that can characterise subtle effects due to dynamic range compression. These models are compared with each other as well as handcrafted features proposed in previous work. The evaluation of the relations between the hyperparameters of DNN and DRC parameters are also provided. The best model is able to produce a universal feature embedding that is capable of predicting multiple DRC parameters simultaneously, which is a significant improvement from our previous research. The feature embedding shows better performance than handcrafted audio features when predicting DRC parameters for both mono-instrument audio loops and polyphonic music pieces.},

Very few studies have investigated pedalling techniques, which form an important aspect of expressive piano music performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method for piano sustain-pedal detection based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Inspired by different acoustic characteristics at the start (pedal onset) versus during the pedalled segment, two binary classifiers are trained separately to learn both temporal dependencies and timbral features using CNN. Their outputs are fused in order to decide whether a portion in a piano recording is played with the sustain pedal. The proposed architecture and our detection system are assessed using a dataset with frame-wise pedal on/off annotations. An average F1 score of 0.74 is obtained for the test set. The method performs better on pieces of Romantic-era composers, who intended to deliver more colours to the piano sound through pedalling techniques.},

Listeners nod significantly more than speakers in the high frequency domain. This asymmetry may be an important factor in coordination.

This process uses performance methods combined with specially designed real-time movement visualisations to progressively build fantasy narratives that are enacted with and for other workshop participants. Qualitative evaluations suggest this process successfully stimulates participant’s embodied imagination and generates a diverse range of fantasies. The interactive and communal aspects of the workshop process appear to be especially important in achieving these effects.

abstract = {In live performances seated audiences have restricted opportunities for response. Some responses are obvious, such as applause and cheering, but there are also many apparently incidental movements including posture shifts, fixing hair, scratching and adjusting glasses. Do these movements provide clues to people's level of engagement with a performance? Our basic hypothesis is that audience responses are part of a bi-directional system of audience-performer communication. This communication is part of what distinguishes live from recorded performance and underpins live performers' moment-to-moment sense of how well a performance is going. Here we investigate the range of visible real-time movements of audiences in four live contemporary dance performances. Video recordings of performers and audiences were analyzed using computer vision techniques for extracting face, hand and body movement data. The meaning of audience movements were analyzed by comparing clips of the audience at moments of maximum and minimum movement to expert and novice judges. The results show that audience clips with the lowest overall movement are judged as displaying the highest engagement. In addition, we found that while there is no systematic relationship between audience and dancers movement, hands seem to play an especially significant role since they move significantly more compared to the rest of the body. We draw on these findings to argue that collective stillness is an especially salient signal of audience engagement.},

We designed a workshop where groups of DMI designers were given the same partly-finished instrument consisting of four microphones exciting four vibrating string models. Their task was to refine this simple instrument to their liking for one hour using Pure Data software. All groups sought to use the microphone signals to control the instrument’s behaviour in rich and complex ways, but found even apparently simple mappings difficult to realise within the time constraint. We describe the difficulties they encountered and discuss emergent issues with tinkering in and with software. We conclude with further questions and suggestions for designers and technologists regarding embedded DMI design processes and tools.},

of values emerging from the specific community, culture and
context in which that technology is created. Within the domain
of musical interaction, HCI research often examines new digital
tools and technologies which can carry unstated cultural
assumptions. This paper takes a step back to present a value
discovery exercise exploring the breadth of perspectives different
communities might have in relation to the values inscribed
in fictional technologies for musical interaction. We conducted
a hands-on activity in which musicians active in different contexts
were invited to envision not-yet-existent musical instruments.
The activity revealed several sources of influence on
participants’ artefacts, including cultural background, instrumental
training, and prior experience with music technology.
Our discussion highlights the importance of cultural awareness
and value rationality for the design of interactive systems
within and beyond the musical domain.},

abstract = {Playing with correct intonation is one of the major challenges for a string player. A player must learn how to physically reproduce a target pitch, but before that, the player must learn what correct intonation is. This requires audiation- the aural equivalent of visualization- of every note along with self-assessment whether the pitch played matches the target, and if not, what action should be taken to correct it. A challenge for successful learning is that much of it occurs during practice, typically without outside supervision. A student who has not yet learned to hear correct intonation may repeatedly practice out of tune, blithely normalizing bad habits and bad intonation. The real-time reflective nature of intonation and its consistent demand on attention make it a ripe target for technological intervention. Using a violin augmented to combine fingerboard sensors with audio analysis for real-time pitch detection, we examine the efficacy of three methods of real-time feedback for improving intonation and pitch learning. The first, aural feedback in the form of an in-tune guide pitch following the student in real-time, is inspired by the tradition of students playing along with teachers. The second is visual feedback on intonation correctness using an algorithm optimized for use throughout normal practice. The third is a combination of the two methods, simultaneously providing aural and visual feedback. Twelve beginning violinists, including children and adults, were given four in-situ 20-30 min lessons. Each lesson used one of the intonation feedback methods, along with a control lesson using no feedback. We collected data on intonation accuracy and conducted interviews on student experience and preference. The results varied by player, with evidence of some players being helped by the feedback methods but also cases where the feedback was distracting and intonation suffered. However interviews suggested a high level of interest and potential in having such tools to help during practice, and results also suggested that it takes time to learn to use the real-time aural and visual feedback. Both methods of feedback demonstrate potential for assisting self-reflection during individual practice.},

In this paper, we draw comparisons in design, evaluation and marketing across four domains: crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo; the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference; conferences in human-computer interaction (HCI); and researchers  creating accessible instruments for children and adults with disabilities. We observe striking differences in approach between commercial and academic projects, with less pronounced differences between each of the academic communities.

abstract = {Auditory prediction error responses elicited by surprising sounds can be reliably recorded with musical stimuli that are more complex and realistic than those typically employed in EEG or MEG oddball paradigms. However, these responses are reduced as the predictive uncertainty of the stimuli increases. In this study, we investigate whether this effect is modulated by musical expertise. Magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) responses were recorded from 26 musicians and 24 non-musicians while they listened to low- and high-uncertainty melodic sequences in a musical multi-feature paradigm that included pitch, slide, intensity and timbre deviants. When compared to non-musicians, musically trained participants had significantly larger pitch and slide MMNm responses. However, both groups showed comparable reductions in pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-uncertainty condition compared with the low-uncertainty condition. In a separate, behavioural deviance detection experiment, musicians were more accurate and confident about their responses than non-musicians, but deviance detection in both groups was similarly affected by the uncertainty of the melodies. In both experiments, the interaction between uncertainty and expertise was not significant, suggesting that the effect is comparable in both groups. Consequently, our results replicate the modulatory effect of predictive uncertainty on prediction error; show that it is present across different types of listeners; and suggest that expertise-related and stimulus-driven modulations of predictive precision are dissociable and independent.},

abstract = {Prediction is held to be a fundamental process underpinning perception, action, and cognition. To examine the time course of prediction error signaling, we recorded intracranial EEG activity from nine presurgical epileptic patients while they listened to melodies whose information theoretical predictability had been characterized using a computational model. We examined oscillatory activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, lateral cortical areas previously implicated in auditory predictive processing. We also examined activity in anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), insula, and amygdala to determine whether signatures of prediction error signaling may also be observable in these subcortical areas. Our results demonstrate that the information content (a measure of unexpectedness) of musical notes modulates the amplitude of low-frequency oscillatory activity (theta to beta power) in bilateral STG and right MTG from within 100 and 200 msec of note onset, respectively. Our results also show this cortical activity to be accompanied by low-frequency oscillatory modulation in ACG and insula-areas previously associated with mediating physiological arousal. Finally, we showed that modulation of low-frequency activity is followed by that of high-frequency (gamma) power from approximately 200 msec in the STG, between 300 and 400 msec in the left insula, and between 400 and 500 msec in the ACG. We discuss these results with respect to models of neural processing that emphasize gamma activity as an index of prediction error signaling and highlight the usefulness of musical stimuli in revealing the wide-reaching neural consequences of predictive processing.},

abstract = {© 2019, The Author(s). Both movement and neural activity in humans can be entrained by the regularities of an external stimulus, such as the beat of musical rhythms. Neural entrainment to auditory rhythms supports temporal perception, and is enhanced by selective attention and by hierarchical temporal structure imposed on rhythms. However, it is not known how neural entrainment to rhythms is related to the subjective experience of groove (the desire to move along with music or rhythm), the perception of a regular beat, the perception of complexity, and the experience of pleasure. In two experiments, we used musical rhythms (from Steve Reich’s Clapping Music) to investigate whether rhythms that are performed by humans (with naturally variable timing) and rhythms that are mechanical (with precise timing), elicit differences in (1) neural entrainment, as measured by inter-trial phase coherence, and (2) subjective ratings of the complexity, preference, groove, and beat strength of rhythms. We also combined results from the two experiments to investigate relationships between neural entrainment and subjective perception of musical rhythms. We found that mechanical rhythms elicited a greater degree of neural entrainment than performed rhythms, likely due to the greater temporal precision in the stimulus, and the two types only elicited different ratings for some individual rhythms. Neural entrainment to performed rhythms, but not to mechanical ones, correlated with subjective desire to move and subjective complexity. These data, therefore, suggest multiple interacting influences on neural entrainment to rhythms, from low-level stimulus properties to high-level cognition and perception.},

In addition to the lexical content of a patient's responses, multimodal cues concurrent with the responses are indicators of their motor and cognitive state, including those derivable from their voice quality and gestural behaviour. In this paper, we use information from different modalities in order to train a classifier capable of detecting the binary state of a subject (clinically depressed or not), as well as the level of their depression. We propose a model that is able to perform modality fusion incrementally after each word in an utterance using a time-dependent recurrent approach in a deep learning set-up. To mitigate noisy modalities, we utilize fusion gates that control the degree to which the audio or visual modality contributes to the final prediction. Our results show the effectiveness of word-level multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results in depression detection and outperforming early feature-level and late fusion techniques.},

We consider altruism as the willingness of an agent to engage in cooperative interactions with other agents regardless of the cost, whereas a mutualistic agent will cooperate if the expected outcome of the interaction is beneficial to itself. Agents engage in a language game in which they have to align their languages to carry out an action. Coordinating the language is costly, as is carrying out the action itself, a fact which influences their decision to help each other. Our model includes a revision protocol which allows individuals to adopt the cooperation strategy of more successful agents. Our results show that, if the costs are too high, mutualistic agents will enjoy a fitness advantage and that the unwillingness of agents to help each other will make it impossible for the population to reach a common language.},

One of the methods developed for tackling this issue consists of creating customizable object-based audio mixes where users can attenuate parts of the mix using a simple complexity parameter. The method relies on the mixing engineer classifying audio objects in the mix according to their narrative importance. This paper focuses on automating this process. Individual tracks are classified based on their music, speech, or sound effect content. Then the decisions for assigning narrative importance to each segment of a radio drama mix are modelled using mixture distributions. Finally, the learned decisions and resultant mixes are evaluated using the Short Term Objective Intelligibility, with reference to the narrative importance selections made by the original producer. This approach has applications for providing customizable mixes for legacy content, or automatically generated media content where the engineer is not able to intervene.},

Most existing methods for nonlinear modeling are often either simplified or optimized to a very specific circuit. In this work, we investigate deep learning architectures for audio processing and we aim to find a general purpose end-to-end deep neural network to perform modeling of nonlinear audio effects. We show the network modeling various nonlinearities and we discuss the generalization capabilities among different instruments.},

abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. In audio signal processing, probabilistic time-frequency models have many benefits over their non-probabilistic counterparts. They adapt to the incoming signal, quantify uncertainty, and measure correlation between the signal's amplitude and phase information, making time domain resynthesis straightforward. However, these models are still not widely used since they come at a high computational cost, and because they are formulated in such a way that it can be difficult to interpret all the modelling assumptions. By showing their equivalence to Spectral Mixture Gaussian processes, we illuminate the underlying model assumptions and provide a general framework for constructing more complex models that better approximate real-world signals. Our interpretation makes it intuitive to inspect, compare, and alter the models since all prior knowledge is encoded in the Gaussian process kernel functions. We utilise a state space representation to perform efficient inference via Kalman smoothing, and we demonstrate how our interpretation allows for efficient parameter learning in the frequency domain.},

title = {Intelligent Subgrouping of Multitrack Audio},
year = {2019},
abstract = {Subgrouping facilitates the simultaneous manipulation of a number of audio tracks and
is a central aspect of mix engineering. However, the decision process of subgrouping is
a poorly documented technique. This research sheds light on this ubiquitous but poorly
de ned mix practice, provides rules and constraints on how it should be approached as
well as demonstrates its bene t to an automatic mixing system.
I  rst explored the relationship that subgrouping has with perceived mix quality by
examining a number of mix projects. This was in order to decipher the actual process
of creating subgroups and to see if any of the decisions made were intrinsically linked
to mix quality. I found mix quality to be related to the number of subgroups and type
of subgroup processing used. This subsequently led me to interviewing distinguished
professionals in the audio engineering  eld, with the intention of gaining a deeper understanding
of the process. The outcome of these interviews and the previous analyses
of mix projects allowed me to propose rules that could be used for real life mixing and
automatic mixing. Some of the rules I established were used to research and develop a
method for the automatic creation of subgroups using machine learning techniques.
I also investigated the relationship between music production quality and human emotion.
This was to see if music production quality had an emotional e ect on a particular
type of listener. The results showed that the emotional impact of mixing only really mattered
to those with critical listening skills. This result is important for automatic mixing
systems in general, as it would imply that quality only really matters to a minority of
people.
I concluded my research on subgrouping by conducting an experiment to see if subgrouping
would bene t the perceived clarity and quality of a mix. The results of a subjective
listening test showed this to be true.},

The majority of Digital Audio Workstation designs represent mix data using a channel strip metaphor. While this is a familiar design based on physical mixing desk layout, it can lead to a visually complex interface incorporating a large number of User Interface objects which can increase the need for navigation and disrupt the mixing workflow. Within other areas of data visualisation, multivariate data objects such as glyphs are used to simultaneously represent a number of parameters within one graphical object by assigning data to specific visual variables. This can reduce screen clutter, enhance visual search and support visual analysis and interpretation of data. This paper reports on two subjective evaluation studies that investigate the efficacy of different design strategies to visually encode mix information (volume, pan, reverb and delay) within a stage metaphor mixer using multivariate data objects and a channel strip design using faders and dials. The analysis of the data suggest that compared to channel strip designs, multivariate objects can lead to quicker visual search without any subsequent reduction in search accuracy.},

A similarity-based method is introduced that relies on perceptually relevant characteristics of reverberation. This method is developed using a publicly available dataset of algorithmic reverberation settings. Semantic word vectors are introduced to exploit semantic correlation among tags and allow for unseen words to be used for retrieval. Average precision is reported on a subset of the dataset as well as tagging of recorded room impulse responses. The developed approach manages to assign downloaded room impulse responses to tags that match their short descriptions. Furthermore, introducing semantic word vectors allows it to perform well even when large portions of the training data have been replaced by synonyms.},

abstract = {© 2019 The Audio Engineering Society (AES). All rights reserved. Sample-based synthesis is a widely used method of synthesising the sounds of live instrumental performances, but the control of such sampler instruments is made difficult by the number of parameters that control the output, the expertise required to set those parameters and by the constraints of the real-time system. In this paper, the principles of descriptor-driven synthesis were used to develop a pair of software tools that aid the user in the specific task of reproducing a live performance using a sampler instrument, by the automatic generation of MIDI controller messages derived from analysis of the input audio. The techniques employed build on existing work and commercially available products. The output of the system is compared to manipulation by expert users. The results show that the system outperforms the human version, despite the latter taking considerably more time. Future developments of the techniques are discussed, including the application to automatic performer replication.},

This is achieved thanks to a physical modelling approach and existing web tools like the Web Audio API. A modular architecture was followed, making the code versatile and easy to reuse, which encourages the development of higher-level models based on the existing ones, as well as similar models based on the same principles. The final implementations present satisfactory performance results despite some minor issues.},

abstract = {© 147th Audio Engineering Society International Convention 2019. All rights reserved. We present a synthesis algorithm for approximating bird song using particle swarm optimization to match real bird recordings. Frequency and amplitude envelope curves are first extracted from a bird recording. Further analysis identifies the presence of even and odd harmonics. A particle swarm algorithm is then used to find cubic Bezier curves which emulate the envelopes. These curves are applied to modulate a sine oscillator and its harmonics. The synthesised syllable can then be repeated to generate the sound. 36 bird sounds have been emulated this way, and a real-time web-based demonstrator is available, with user control of all parameters. Objective evaluation showed that the synthesised bird sounds captured most audio features of the recordings.},

We investigate listener preference in multitrack music production using the Mix Evaluation Dataset, comprised of 184 mixes across 19 songs. Features are extracted from verses and choruses of stereo mixdowns. Each observation is associated with an average listener preference rating and standard deviation of preference ratings. Principal component analysis is performed to analyze how mixes vary within the feature space. We demonstrate that virtually no correlation is found between the embedded features and either average preference or standard deviation of preference. We instead propose using principal component projections as a semantic embedding space by associating each observation with listener comments from the Mix Evaluation Dataset. Initial results disagree with simple descriptions such as “width” or “loudness” for principal component axes.},

year = {2019},
abstract = {© 2019 The Audio Engineering Society (AES). All rights reserved. One of the most important tasks in audio production is to place sound sources across the stereo field so as to reduce masking and immerse the listener within the space. This process of panning sources of a multitrack recording to achieve spatialization and masking minimization is a challenging optimization problem, mainly because of the complexity of auditory perception. We propose a novel panning system that makes use of a common framework for spectral decomposition, masking detection, multitrack sub-grouping and frequency-based spreading. It creates a well spatialized mix with increased clarity while complying to the best panning practices. Both real-time and offline optimization-based approaches are designed and implemented. We investigate the reduction of inter-track auditory masking using the MPEG psychoacoustic model along with various other masking and spatialization metrics, extended for multitrack content. Subjective and objective tests compare the proposed work against mixes by professional sound engineers and existing auto-mix systems.},

We show how time-frequency analysis and non-negative matrix factorisation can be jointly formulated as a spectral mixture Gaussian process model with nonstationary priors over the amplitude variance parameters. Further, we formulate this nonlinear model's state space representation, making it amenable to infinite-horizon Gaussian process regression with approximate inference via expectation propagation, which scales linearly in the number of time steps and quadratically in the state dimensionality. By doing so, we are able to process audio signals with hundreds of thousands of data points. We demonstrate, on various tasks with empirical data, how this inference scheme outperforms more standard techniques that rely on extended Kalman filtering.},
