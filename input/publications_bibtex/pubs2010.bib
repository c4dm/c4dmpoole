	Abstract = {The promise of the Semantic Web is to democratise access
 to data, allowing anyone to make use of and contribute back to the
 global store of knowledge.  Within the scope of the OMRAS2 Music
 Information Retrieval project, we have made use of and contributed to
 Semantic Web technologies for purposes ranging from the publication of
 music recording metadata to the online dissemination of results from
 audio analysis algorithms.  In this paper, we assess the extent to
 which our tools and frameworks can assist in research and facilitate
 distributed work among audio and music researchers, and enumerate and
 motivate further steps to improve collaborative efforts in music
 informatics using the Semantic Web.  To this end, we review some of
 the tools developed by the OMRAS2 project, examine the extent to which
 our work reflects the Semantic Web paradigm, and discuss some of the
 remaining work needed to fulfil the promise of online music
 informatics research.

	Abstract = {In timbre remapping applications such as concatenative synthesis, an audio signal is used as a template, and a mapping process derives control data for some audio synthesis algorithm such that it produces a new audio signal approximating the perceived trajectory of the original sound. Timbre is a multidimensional attribute with interactions between dimensions, and the control and synthesised signals typically represent sounds with different timbral ranges, so it is non-trivial to design a search process which makes best use of the timbral variety available in the synthesiser. We first discuss our preliminary work applying standard machine-learning techniques for this purpose (PCA, self-organising maps), and the reasons they were not satisfactory. We then describe a novel regression-tree technique which learns associations between unlabelled multidimensional timbre distributions.

	Abstract = {Real-time classification applied to a vocal percussion signal holds potential as an interface for live musical control. In this article we propose a novel approach to resolving the tension between the needs for low-latency reaction and reliable classification, by deferring the final classification decision until after a response has been initiated. We introduce a new dataset of annotated human beatbox recordings, and use it to study the optimal delay for classification accuracy. We then investigate the effect of such delayed decision-making on the quality of the audio output via a MUSHRA-type listening test. Our results show that the effect depends on the output audio type: for popular dance/pop drum sounds the acceptable delay is on the order of 12--35 ms.

	Year = {2010},
	Abstract = {We consider the task of inferring associations between two differently-distributed and unlabelled sets of timbre data. This arises in applications such as concatenative synthesis/ audio mosaicing in which one audio recording is used to control sound synthesis through concatenating fragments of an unrelated source recording. Timbre is a multidimensional attribute with interactions between dimensions, so it is non-trivial to design a search process which makes best use of the timbral variety available in the source recording. We must be able to map from control signals whose timbre features have different distributions from the source material, yet labelling large collections of timbral sounds is often impractical, so we seek an unsupervised technique which can infer relationships between distributions. We present a regression tree technique which learns associations between two unlabelled multidimensional distributions, and apply the technique to a simple timbral concatenative synthesis system. We demonstrate numerically that the mapping makes better use of the source material than a nearest-neighbour search.
